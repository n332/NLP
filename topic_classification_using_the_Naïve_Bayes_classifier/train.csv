== Etymology ==


=== Common name “Muscovy” ===

""Muscovy"" is an old name for the region of Russia surrounding Moscow, but these ducks are neither native there nor were introduced there before they became known in Western Europe",0
" It is not quite clear how the term came about; it very likely originated between 1550 and 1600, but did not become widespread until somewhat later",0
"
In one suggestion, it has been claimed that the Company of Merchant Adventurers to New Lands traded these ducks to Europe occasionally after 1550; this chartered company became eventually known as the ""Muscovy Company"" or ""Muscovite Company"" so the ducks might thus have come to be called ""Muscovite ducks"" or ""Muscovy ducks"" in keeping with the common practice of attaching the importer's name to the products they sold",0
" But while the Muscovite Company initiated vigorous trade with Russia, they hardly, if at all, traded produce from the Americas; thus, they are unlikely to have traded C",0
 moschata to a significant extent,0
"
Alternatively—just as in the ""turkey"" (which is also from North America, not Turkey) and the ""guineafowl"" (which are not limited to Guinea)—""Muscovy"" might be simply a generic term for an exotic place, in reference to the singular appearance of these birds",0
" This is evidenced by other names suggesting the species came from lands where it is not actually native, but from where much ""outlandish"" produce was imported at that time (see below)",0
"
Yet another view—not incompatible with either of those discussed above—connects the species with the Muisca, a Native American nation in today's Colombia",0
" The duck is native to these lands also, and it is likely that it was kept by the Muisca as a domestic animal to some extent",0
" It is conceivable that a term like ""Muisca duck"", hard to comprehend for the average European of those times, would be corrupted into something more familiar",0
" Likewise, the Miskito Indians of the Miskito Coast in Nicaragua and Honduras heavily relied on it as a domestic species, and the ducks as well may have been named after this region",0
"


=== Species name “moschata” ===

Linnaeus’ description of Anas moschata only consists of a curt but entirely unequivocal [Anas] facie nuda papillosa (""A duck with a naked and carunculated face""), and his primary reference is his earlier work Fauna Svecica",0
" But Linnaeus refers also to older sources, wherein much information on the origin of the common name is found",0
"
Conrad Gessner is given by Linnaeus as a source, but the Historia animalium mentions the Muscovy duck only in passing",0
" Ulisse Aldrovandi discusses the species in detail, referring to the wild birds and its domestic breeds variously as anas cairina, anas indica or anas libyca – ""duck from Cairo"", ""Indian duck"" (in reference to the West Indies) or ""Libyan duck""",0
" But his anas indica (based, like Gessner's brief discussion, ultimately on the reports of Christopher Columbus's travels) also seems to have included another species, perhaps a whistling-duck (Dendrocygna)",0
" Already however the species is tied to some more or less nondescript ""exotic"" locality – ""Libya"" could still refer to any place in Northern Africa at that time – where it did not natively occur",0
" Francis Willughby discusses ""The Muscovy duck"" as anas moschata and expresses his belief that Aldrovandi's and Gessner's anas cairina, anas indica and anas libyca (which he calls ""The Guiny duck"", adding another mistaken place of origin to the list) refer to the very same species",0
" Finally, John Ray attempts to clear up the confusion by providing an alternative explanation for the name's etymology:

In English, it is called The Muscovy-Duck, though this is not transferred from Muscovia [the New Latin name of Muscovy], but from the rather strong musk odour it exudes",0
"
Linnaeus came to witness the birds' ""gamey"" aroma first-hand, as he attests in the Fauna Svecica and again in the travelogue of this 1746 Västergötland excursion",0
" Similarly, the Russian name of this species, muskusnaya utka (Мускусная утка), means ""musk duck"" – without any reference to Moscow – as do the Bokmål and Danish moskusand, Dutch muskuseend, Finnish myskisorsa, French canard musqué, German Moschusente, Italian anatra muschiata, Spanish pato almizclado and Swedish myskand",0
" In English, however, musk duck refers to the Australian species Biziura lobata",0
"


=== Genus name ""Cairina"" ===
The currently assigned genus name Cairina, meanwhile, traces its origin to Aldrovandi and the mistaken belief that the birds came from Egypt: translated, the current scientific name of the Muscovy duck means ""the musky one from Cairo""",0
"


=== Other names ===
In some regions the name ""Barbary duck"" is used for domestic and ""Muscovy duck"" for wild birds; in other places, ""Barbary duck"" refers specifically to the dressed carcass, while ""Muscovy duck"" applies to living C",0
" moschata, regardless of whether they are wild or domestic",0
" In general, ""Barbary duck"" is the usual term for C",0
 moschata in a culinary context,0
"


== Taxonomy and systematics ==

The species was first scientifically described by Carl Linnaeus in his 1758 edition of Systema Naturae as Anas moschata, literally meaning ""musk duck""",0
" It was later transferred to the genus Cairina, making its current binomial name Cairina moschata",0
"
The Muscovy duck was formerly placed into the paraphyletic ""perching duck"" assemblage, but subsequently moved to the dabbling duck subfamily (Anatinae)",0
" Analysis of the mtDNA sequences of the cytochrome b and NADH dehydrogenase subunit 2 genes, however, indicates that it might be closer to the genus Aix and better placed in the shelduck subfamily Tadorninae",0
" In addition, the other species of Cairina, the rare white-winged duck (C",0
" scutulata), seems to belong to a distinct genus (Asarcornis)",0
"


== Ecology ==
This non-migratory species normally inhabits forested swamps, lakes, streams and nearby grassland and farm crops, and often roosts in trees at night",0
" The Muscovy duck's diet consists of plant material (such as the roots, stems, leaves, and seeds of aquatic plants and grasses, as well as terrestrial plants, including agricultural crops) obtained by grazing or dabbling in shallow water, and small fish, amphibians, reptiles, crustaceans, insects, millipedes, and worms",0
" This is an aggressive duck; males often fight over food, territory or mates",0
 The females fight with each other less often,0
 Some adults will peck at the ducklings if they are eating at the same food source,0
"
The Muscovy duck has benefited from nest boxes in Mexico, but is somewhat uncommon in much of the eastern part of its range due to excessive hunting",0
" It is not considered a globally threatened species by the IUCN, however, as it is widely distributed",0
"


=== Reproduction ===

This species, like the mallard, does not form stable pairs",0
 They will mate on land or in water (note the submerged female in the image below),0
 Domestic Muscovy ducks can breed up to three times each year,0
"
The hen lays a clutch of 8–16 white eggs, usually in a tree hole or hollow, which are incubated for 35 days",0
" The sitting hen will leave the nest once a day from 20 minutes to one and a half hours, and will then defecate, drink water, eat and sometimes bathe",0
" Once the eggs begin to hatch, it may take 24 hours for all the chicks to break through their shells",0
" When feral chicks are born, they usually stay with their mother for about 10–12 weeks",0
" Their bodies cannot produce all the heat they need, especially in temperate regions, so they will stay close to the mother, especially at night",0
"
Often, the drake will stay in close contact with the brood for several weeks",0
" The male will walk with the young during their normal travels in search for food, providing protection",0
" Anecdotal evidence from East Anglia, U",0
K,0
" suggests that, in response to different environmental conditions, other adults assist in protecting chicks and providing warmth at night",0
" It has been suggested that this is in response to local efforts to cull the eggs, which has led to an atypical distribution of males and females, as well as young and mature birds",0
"
For the first few weeks of their lives, Muscovy chicks feed on grains, corn, grass, insects, and almost anything that moves",0
 Their mother instructs them at an early age how to feed,0
"


=== Feral bird ===

Feral Muscovy ducks can breed near urban and suburban lakes and on farms, nesting in tree cavities or on the ground, under shrubs in yards, on apartment balconies, or under roof overhangs",0
" Some feral populations, such as that in southern Florida, have a reputation of becoming pests on occasion",0
" At night they often sleep at water, if there is a water source available, to flee quickly from predators if awakened",0
" Small populations of Muscovy ducks can also be found in Ely, Cambridgeshire, Calstock, Cornwall, and Lincoln, Lincolnshire, U",0
K,0
 Muscovy ducks have also been spotted in the Walsall Arboretum,0
" There has been a small population in the Pavilion Gardens public park in Buxton, Derbyshire for many years",0
In the U,0
S,0
", Muscovy ducks are considered an non-native species",0
 An owner may raise them for food production only (not for hunting),0
" Similarly, if the ducks have no owner, 50CFR Part 21 (Migratory Bird Permits) allows the removal or destruction of the ducks, their eggs and their nests anywhere in the United States outside of Hidalgo, Starr and Zapata Counties in Texas, where they are considered indigenous",0
" The population in southern Florida is considered, with numbers in the several thousands, to be established enough to be considered ""countable"" for bird watchers",0
"Legal methods to restrict breeding include not feeding these ducks, deterring them with noise or chasing them away",0
"
Although legislation passed in the U",0
S,0
" prohibiting trade of Muscovy ducks, Fish and Wildlife Services intend to revise the regulations",0
" They are not currently implementing them, though release of Muscovy ducks to the wild outside their natural range is prohibited",0
"


== Domestication ==

Muscovy ducks had been domesticated by various Native American cultures in the Americas when Columbus arrived in the Bahamas",0
" A few were brought onto Columbus' ship the Santa Maria, they then sailed back to Europe by the 16th century",0
"
The Muscovy duck has been domesticated for centuries, and is widely traded as ""Barbary duck""",0
" Muscovy breeds are popular because they have stronger-tasting meat—sometimes compared to roast beef—than the usual domestic ducks, which are descendants of the mallard (Anas platyrhynchos)",0
" The meat is lean when compared to the fatty meat of mallard-derived ducks, its leanness and tenderness being often compared to veal",0
" Muscovy ducks are also less noisy, and sometimes marketed as a ""quackless"" duck; even though they are not completely silent, they do not actually quack (except in cases of extreme stress)",0
" The carcass of a Muscovy duck is also much heavier than most other domestic ducks, which makes it ideal for the dinner table",0
"

Domesticated Muscovy ducks, like those pictured, often have plumage features differing from other wild birds",0
" White breeds are preferred for meat production, as darker ones can have much melanin in the skin, which some people find unappealing",0
"
The Muscovy duck can be crossed with mallards in captivity to produce hybrids known as mulards (""mule ducks"") because they are sterile",0
 Muscovy drakes are commercially crossed with mallard-derived hens either naturally or by artificial insemination,0
" The 40–60% of eggs that are fertile result in birds raised only for their meat or for production of foie gras: they grow fast like mallard-derived breeds, but to a large size like Muscovy ducks",0
" Conversely, though crossing mallard-derived drakes with Muscovy hens is possible, the offspring are neither desirable for meat nor for egg production",0
"In addition, Muscovy ducks are reportedly crossbred in Israel with mallards to produce kosher duck products",0
 The kashrut status of the Muscovy duck has been a matter of rabbinic discussion for over 150 years,0
Oscillococcinum is a homeopathic preparation made from Muscovy duck livers and hearts manufactured by the French company Boiron; similar products are also available from other manufacturers,0
" Typically diluted with lactose and sucrose to 1:10400 (far less than one in one googol), they are advertised to relieve influenza-like symptoms, but no evidence has been found of their efficacy",0
"A study examining birds in northwestern Colombia for blood parasites found the Muscovy duck to be more frequently infected with Haemoproteus and malaria (Plasmodium) parasites than chickens, domestic pigeons, domestic turkeys and, in fact, almost all wild bird species also studied",0
" It was noted that in other parts of the world, chickens were more susceptible to such infections than in the study area, but it may well be that Muscovy ducks are generally more often infected with such parasites (which might not cause pronounced disease, though, and are harmless to humans)",0

The cat (Felis catus) is a domestic species of small carnivorous mammal,0
 It is the only domesticated species in the family Felidae and is commonly referred to as the domestic cat or house cat to distinguish it from the wild members of the family,0
 Cats are commonly kept as house pets but can also be farm cats or feral cats; the feral cat ranges freely and avoids human contact,0
 Domestic cats are valued by humans for companionship and their ability to kill rodents,0
 About 60 cat breeds are recognized by various cat registries,0
"The cat is similar in anatomy to the other felid species: it has a strong flexible body, quick reflexes, sharp teeth, and retractable claws adapted to killing small prey like mice and rats",0
 Its night vision and sense of smell are well developed,0
" Cat communication includes vocalizations like meowing, purring, trilling, hissing, growling, and grunting as well as cat-specific body language",0
" Although the cat is a social species, it is a solitary hunter",0
" As a predator, it is crepuscular, i",0
e,0
 most active at dawn and dusk,0
" It can hear sounds too faint or too high in frequency for human ears, such as those made by mice and other small mammals",0
 It also secretes and perceives pheromones,0
"Female domestic cats can have kittens from spring to late autumn, with litter sizes often ranging from two to five kittens",0
" Domestic cats are bred and shown at events as registered pedigreed cats, a hobby known as cat fancy",0
" Population control of cats may be achieved by spaying and neutering, but their proliferation and the abandonment of pets has resulted in large numbers of feral cats worldwide, contributing to the extinction of entire bird, mammal, and reptile species",0
"It was long thought that cat domestication began in ancient Egypt, where cats were venerated from around 3100 BC, but recent advances in archaeology and genetics have shown that their domestication occurred in Western Asia around 7500 BC",0
"As of 2021, there were an estimated 220 million owned and 480 million stray cats in the world",0
" As of 2017, the domestic cat was the second most popular pet in the United States, with 95",0
6 million cats owned and around 42 million households owning at least one cat,0
" In the United Kingdom, 26% of adults have a cat, with an estimated population of 10",0
9 million pet cats as of 2020,0
"


== Etymology and naming ==
The origin of the English word cat, Old English catt, is thought to be the Late Latin word cattus, which was first used at the beginning of the 6th century",0
" It was suggested that cattus is derived from an Egyptian precursor of Coptic ϣⲁⲩ šau, 'tomcat', or its feminine form suffixed with -t",0
 The Late Latin word may be derived from another Afro-Asiatic or Nilo-Saharan language,0
 The Nubian word kaddîska 'wildcat' and Nobiin kadīs are possible sources or cognates,0
 The Nubian word may be a loan from Arabic قَطّ‎ qaṭṭ ~ قِطّ qiṭṭ,0
"
However, it is ""equally likely that the forms might derive from an ancient Germanic word, imported into Latin and thence to Greek and to Syriac and Arabic""",0
" The word may be derived from Germanic and Northern European languages, and ultimately be borrowed from Uralic, cf",0
" Northern Sami gáđfi, 'female stoat', and Hungarian hölgy, 'lady, female stoat'; from Proto-Uralic *käďwä, 'female (of a furred animal)'",0
"The English puss, extended as pussy and pussycat, is attested from the 16th century and may have been introduced from Dutch poes or from Low German puuskatte, related to Swedish kattepus, or Norwegian pus, pusekatt",0
 Similar forms exist in Lithuanian puižė and Irish puisín or puiscín,0
" The etymology of this word is unknown, but it may have arisen from a sound used to attract a cat",0
"A male cat is called a tom or tomcat (or a gib, if neutered)",0
" A female is called a queen (or a molly, if spayed), especially in a cat-breeding context",0
 A juvenile cat is referred to as a kitten,0
" In Early Modern English, the word kitten was interchangeable with the now-obsolete word catling",0
 A group of cats can be referred to as a clowder or a glaring,0
"


== Taxonomy ==
The scientific name Felis catus was proposed by Carl Linnaeus in 1758 for a domestic cat",0
 Felis catus domesticus was proposed by Johann Christian Polycarp Erxleben in 1777,0
" Felis daemon proposed by Konstantin Satunin in 1904 was a black cat from the Transcaucasus, later identified as a domestic cat",0
"In 2003, the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature ruled that the domestic cat is a distinct species, namely Felis catus",0
"
In 2007, it was considered a subspecies, F",0
" silvestris catus, of the European wildcat (F",0
 silvestris) following results of phylogenetic research,0
" In 2017, the IUCN Cat Classification Taskforce followed the recommendation of the ICZN in regarding the domestic cat as a distinct species, Felis catus",0
"


== Evolution ==

The domestic cat is a member of the Felidae, a family that had a common ancestor about 10–15 million years ago",0
"
The genus Felis diverged from other Felidae around 6–7 million years ago",0
" Results of phylogenetic research confirm that the wild Felis species evolved through sympatric or parapatric speciation, whereas the domestic cat evolved through artificial selection",0
" The domesticated cat and its closest wild ancestor are diploid and both possess 38 chromosomes and roughly 20,000 genes",0
 The leopard cat (Prionailurus bengalensis) was tamed independently in China around 5500 BC,0
 This line of partially domesticated cats leaves no trace in the domestic cat populations of today,0
"


=== Domestication ===

The earliest known indication for the taming of an African wildcat (F",0
" lybica) was excavated close by a human Neolithic grave in Shillourokambos, southern Cyprus, dating to about 7500–7200 BC",0
" Since there is no evidence of native mammalian fauna on Cyprus, the inhabitants of this Neolithic village most likely brought the cat and other wild mammals to the island from the Middle Eastern mainland",0
" Scientists therefore assume that African wildcats were attracted to early human settlements in the Fertile Crescent by rodents, in particular the house mouse (Mus musculus), and were tamed by Neolithic farmers",0
 This mutual relationship between early farmers and tamed cats lasted thousands of years,0
" As agricultural practices spread, so did tame and domesticated cats",0
 Wildcats of Egypt contributed to the maternal gene pool of the domestic cat at a later time,0
The earliest known evidence for the occurrence of the domestic cat in Greece dates to around 1200 BC,0
" Greek, Phoenician, Carthaginian and Etruscan traders introduced domestic cats to southern Europe",0
 During the Roman Empire they were introduced to Corsica and Sardinia before the beginning of the 1st millennium,0
" By the 5th century BC, they were familiar animals around settlements in Magna Graecia and Etruria",0
" By the end of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century, the Egyptian domestic cat lineage had arrived in a Baltic Sea port in northern Germany",0
"During domestication, cats have undergone only minor changes in anatomy and behavior, and they are still capable of surviving in the wild",0
 Several natural behaviors and characteristics of wildcats may have pre-adapted them for domestication as pets,0
" These traits include their small size, social nature, obvious body language, love of play, and high intelligence",0
 Captive Leopardus cats may also display affectionate behavior toward humans but were not domesticated,0
 House cats often mate with feral cats,0
" Hybridisation between domestic and other Felinae species is also possible, producing hybrids such as the Kellas cat in Scotland",0
Development of cat breeds started in the mid 19th century,0
" An analysis of the domestic cat genome revealed that the ancestral wildcat genome was significantly altered in the process of domestication, as specific mutations were selected to develop cat breeds",0
 Most breeds are founded on random-bred domestic cats,0
" Genetic diversity of these breeds varies between regions, and is lowest in purebred populations, which show more than 20 deleterious genetic disorders",0
"


== Characteristics ==


=== Size ===

The domestic cat has a smaller skull and shorter bones than the European wildcat",0
"
It averages about 46 cm (18 in) in head-to-body length and 23–25 cm (9–10 in) in height, with about 30 cm (12 in) long tails",0
 Males are larger than females,0
"
Adult domestic cats typically weigh between 4 and 5 kg (9 and 11 lb)",0
"


=== Skeleton ===
Cats have seven cervical vertebrae (as do most mammals); 13 thoracic vertebrae (humans have 12); seven lumbar vertebrae (humans have five); three sacral vertebrae (as do most mammals, but humans have five); and a variable number of caudal vertebrae in the tail (humans have only three to five vestigial caudal vertebrae, fused into an internal coccyx)",0
: 11  The extra lumbar and thoracic vertebrae account for the cat's spinal mobility and flexibility,0
" Attached to the spine are 13 ribs, the shoulder, and the pelvis",0
": 16  Unlike human arms, cat forelimbs are attached to the shoulder by free-floating clavicle bones which allow them to pass their body through any space into which they can fit their head",0
"


=== Skull ===

The cat skull is unusual among mammals in having very large eye sockets and a powerful specialized jaw",0
": 35  Within the jaw, cats have teeth adapted for killing prey and tearing meat",0
" When it overpowers its prey, a cat delivers a lethal neck bite with its two long canine teeth, inserting them between two of the prey's vertebrae and severing its spinal cord, causing irreversible paralysis and death",0
" Compared to other felines, domestic cats have narrowly spaced canine teeth relative to the size of their jaw, which is an adaptation to their preferred prey of small rodents, which have small vertebrae",0
"The premolar and first molar together compose the carnassial pair on each side of the mouth, which efficiently shears meat into small pieces, like a pair of scissors",0
" These are vital in feeding, since cats' small molars cannot chew food effectively, and cats are largely incapable of mastication",0
": 37  Cats tend to have better teeth than most humans, with decay generally less likely because of a thicker protective layer of enamel, a less damaging saliva, less retention of food particles between teeth, and a diet mostly devoid of sugar",0
 Nonetheless they are subject to occasional tooth loss and infection,0
"


=== Claws ===

Cats have protractible and retractable claws",0
" In their normal, relaxed position, the claws are sheathed with the skin and fur around the paw's toe pads",0
 This keeps the claws sharp by preventing wear from contact with the ground and allows for the silent stalking of prey,0
 The claws on the forefeet are typically sharper than those on the hindfeet,0
 Cats can voluntarily extend their claws on one or more paws,0
" They may extend their claws in hunting or self-defense, climbing, kneading, or for extra traction on soft surfaces",0
 Cats shed the outside layer of their claw sheaths when scratching rough surfaces,0
Most cats have five claws on their front paws and four on their rear paws,0
 The dewclaw is proximal to the other claws,0
" More proximally is a protrusion which appears to be a sixth ""finger""",0
 This special feature of the front paws on the inside of the wrists has no function in normal walking but is thought to be an antiskidding device used while jumping,0
" Some cat breeds are prone to having extra digits (""polydactyly"")",0
 Polydactylous cats occur along North America's northeast coast and in Great Britain,0
"


=== Ambulation ===
The cat is digitigrade",0
" It walks on the toes, with the bones of the feet making up the lower part of the visible leg",0
" Unlike most mammals, it uses a ""pacing"" gait and moves both legs on one side of the body before the legs on the other side",0
" It registers directly by placing each hind paw close to the track of the corresponding fore paw, minimizing noise and visible tracks",0
 This also provides sure footing for hind paws when navigating rough terrain,0
" As it speeds up from walking to trotting, its gait changes to a ""diagonal"" gait: The diagonally opposite hind and fore legs move simultaneously",0
"


=== Balance ===

Most breeds of cat are notably fond of sitting in high places, or perching",0
 A higher place may serve as a concealed site from which to hunt; domestic cats strike prey by pouncing from a perch such as a tree branch,0
" Another possible explanation is that height gives the cat a better observation point, allowing it to survey its territory",0
 A cat falling from heights of up to 3 meters (9,0
8 ft) can right itself and land on its paws,0
"During a fall from a high place, a cat reflexively twists its body and rights itself to land on its feet using its acute sense of balance and flexibility",0
 This reflex is known as the cat righting reflex,0
" A cat always rights itself in the same way during a fall, if it has enough time to do so, which is the case in falls of 90 cm (2 ft 11 in) or more",0
" How cats are able to right themselves when falling has been investigated as the ""falling cat problem""",0
"


=== Coats ===
The cat family (Felidae) can pass down many colors and patterns to their offsprings",0
 The domestic cat genes MC1R and ASIP allow for the variety of color in coats,0
 The feline ASIP gene consists of three coding exons,0
 Three novel microsatellite markers linked to ASIP were isolated from a domestic cat BAC clone containing this gene and were used to perform linkage analysis in a pedigree of 89 domestic cats that segregated for melanism,0
"


== Senses ==


=== Vision ===

Cats have excellent night vision and can see at only one-sixth the light level required for human vision",0
": 43  This is partly the result of cat eyes having a tapetum lucidum, which reflects any light that passes through the retina back into the eye, thereby increasing the eye's sensitivity to dim light",0
 Large pupils are an adaptation to dim light,0
" The domestic cat has slit pupils, which allow it to focus bright light without chromatic aberration",0
" At low light, a cat's pupils expand to cover most of the exposed surface of its eyes",0
" The domestic cat has rather poor color vision and only two types of cone cells, optimized for sensitivity to blue and yellowish green; its ability to distinguish between red and green is limited",0
 A response to middle wavelengths from a system other than the rod cells might be due to a third type of cone,0
 This appears to be an adaptation to low light levels rather than representing true trichromatic vision,0
" Cats also have a nictitating membrane, allowing them to blink without hindering their vision",0
"


=== Hearing ===
The domestic cat's hearing is most acute in the range of 500 Hz to 32 kHz",0
" It can detect an extremely broad range of frequencies ranging from 55 Hz to 79 kHz, whereas humans can only detect frequencies between 20 Hz and 20 kHz",0
 It can hear a range of 10,0
"5 octaves, while humans and dogs can hear ranges of about 9 octaves",0
"
Its hearing sensitivity is enhanced by its large movable outer ears, the pinnae, which amplify sounds and help detect the location of a noise",0
" It can detect ultrasound, which enables it to detect ultrasonic calls made by rodent prey",0
 Recent research has shown that cats have socio-spatial cognitive abilities to create mental maps of owners' locations based on hearing owners' voices,0
"


=== Smell ===
Cats have an acute sense of smell, due in part to their well-developed olfactory bulb and a large surface of olfactory mucosa, about 5",0
"8 square centimetres (29⁄32 square inch) in area, which is about twice that of humans",0
 Cats and many other animals have a Jacobson's organ in their mouths that is used in the behavioral process of flehmening,0
 It allows them to sense certain aromas in a way that humans cannot,0
" Cats are sensitive to pheromones such as 3-mercapto-3-methylbutan-1-ol, which they use to communicate through urine spraying and marking with scent glands",0
" Many cats also respond strongly to plants that contain nepetalactone, especially catnip, as they can detect that substance at less than one part per billion",0
 About 70–80% of cats are affected by nepetalactone,0
" This response is also produced by other plants, such as silver vine (Actinidia polygama) and the herb valerian; it may be caused by the smell of these plants mimicking a pheromone and stimulating cats' social or sexual behaviors",0
"


=== Taste ===
Cats have relatively few taste buds compared to humans (470 or so versus more than 9,000 on the human tongue)",0
" Domestic and wild cats share a taste receptor gene mutation that keeps their sweet taste buds from binding to sugary molecules, leaving them with no ability to taste sweetness",0
" Their taste buds instead respond to acids, amino acids like protein, and bitter tastes",0
" Cats also have a distinct temperature preference for their food, preferring food with a temperature around 38 °C (100 °F) which is similar to that of a fresh kill and routinely rejecting food presented cold or refrigerated (which would signal to the cat that the ""prey"" item is long dead and therefore possibly toxic or decomposing)",0
"


=== Whiskers ===

To aid with navigation and sensation, cats have dozens of movable whiskers (vibrissae) over their body, especially their faces",0
" These provide information on the width of gaps and on the location of objects in the dark, both by touching objects directly and by sensing air currents; they also trigger protective blink reflexes to protect the eyes from damage",0
": 47 


== Behavior ==

Outdoor cats are active both day and night, although they tend to be slightly more active at night",0
 Domestic cats spend the majority of their time in the vicinity of their homes but can range many hundreds of meters from this central point,0
" They establish territories that vary considerably in size, in one study ranging from 7 to 28 hectares (17–69 acres)",0
" The timing of cats' activity is quite flexible and varied but being low-light predators, they are generally crepuscular, which means they tend to be more active in the morning and evening",0
" However, house cats' behaviour is also influenced by human activity and they may adapt to their owners' sleeping patterns to some extent",0
"Cats conserve energy by sleeping more than most animals, especially as they grow older",0
" The daily duration of sleep varies, usually between 12 and 16 hours, with 13 and 14 being the average",0
 Some cats can sleep as much as 20 hours,0
" The term ""cat nap"" for a short rest refers to the cat's tendency to fall asleep (lightly) for a brief period",0
" While asleep, cats experience short periods of rapid eye movement sleep often accompanied by muscle twitches, which suggests they are dreaming",0
"


=== Sociability ===
The social behavior of the domestic cat ranges from widely dispersed individuals to feral cat colonies that gather around a food source, based on groups of co-operating females",0
" Within such groups, one cat is usually dominant over the others",0
" Each cat in a colony holds a distinct territory, with sexually active males having the largest territories, which are about 10 times larger than those of female cats and may overlap with several females' territories",0
" These territories are marked by urine spraying, by rubbing objects at head height with secretions from facial glands, and by defecation",0
 Between these territories are neutral areas where cats watch and greet one another without territorial conflicts,0
" Outside these neutral areas, territory holders usually chase away stranger cats, at first by staring, hissing, and growling and, if that does not work, by short but noisy and violent attacks",0
" Despite this colonial organization, cats do not have a social survival strategy or a pack mentality, and always hunt alone",0
"Life in proximity to humans and other domestic animals has led to a symbiotic social adaptation in cats, and cats may express great affection toward humans or other animals",0
" Ethologically, a cat's human keeper functions as if a mother surrogate",0
" Adult cats live their lives in a kind of extended kittenhood, a form of behavioral neoteny",0
" Their high-pitched sounds may mimic the cries of a hungry human infant, making them particularly difficult for humans to ignore",0
 Some pet cats are poorly socialized,0
" In particular, older cats show aggressiveness toward newly arrived kittens, which include biting and scratching; this type of behavior is known as feline asocial aggression",0
Redirected aggression is a common form of aggression which can occur in multiple cat households,0
" In redirected aggression there is usually something that agitates the cat: this could be a sight, sound, or another source of stimuli which causes a heightened level of anxiety or arousal",0
" If the cat cannot attack the stimuli, it may direct anger elsewhere by attacking or directing aggression to the nearest cat, dog, human or other being",0
Domestic cats' scent rubbing behavior toward humans or other cats is thought to be a feline means for social bonding,0
"


=== Communication ===

Domestic cats use many vocalizations for communication, including purring, trilling, hissing, growling/snarling, grunting, and several different forms of meowing",0
" Their body language, including position of ears and tail, relaxation of the whole body, and kneading of the paws, are all indicators of mood",0
 The tail and ears are particularly important social signal mechanisms in cats,0
" A raised tail indicates a friendly greeting, and flattened ears indicates hostility",0
" Tail-raising also indicates the cat's position in the group's social hierarchy, with dominant individuals raising their tails less often than subordinate ones",0
 Feral cats are generally silent,0
": 208  Nose-to-nose touching is also a common greeting and may be followed by social grooming, which is solicited by one of the cats raising and tilting its head",0
"Purring may have developed as an evolutionary advantage as a signaling mechanism of reassurance between mother cats and nursing kittens, who are thought to use it as a care-soliciting signal",0
"
Post-nursing cats also often purr as a sign of contentment: when being petted, becoming relaxed, or eating",0
" Even though purring is popularly interpreted as indicative of pleasure, it has been recorded in a wide variety of circumstances, most of which involve physical contact between the cat and another, presumably trusted individual",0
" Some cats have been observed to purr continuously when
chronically ill or in apparent pain",0
"The exact mechanism by which cats purr has long been elusive, but it has been proposed that purring is generated via a series of sudden build-ups and releases of pressure as the glottis is opened and closed, which causes the vocal folds to separate forcefully",0
" The laryngeal muscles in control of the glottis
are thought to be driven by a neural oscillator which generates a cycle of contraction and release every 30-40
milliseconds (giving a frequency of 33 to 25 Hz)",0
"


=== Grooming ===

Cats are known for spending considerable amounts of time licking their coats to keep them clean",0
" The cat's tongue has backward-facing spines about 500 μm long, which are called papillae",0
 These contain keratin which makes them rigid so the papillae act like a hairbrush,0
" Some cats, particularly longhaired cats, occasionally regurgitate hairballs of fur that have collected in their stomachs from grooming",0
 These clumps of fur are usually sausage-shaped and about 2–3 cm (3⁄4–1+1⁄4 in) long,0
" Hairballs can be prevented with remedies that ease elimination of the hair through the gut, as well as regular grooming of the coat with a comb or stiff brush",0
"


=== Fighting ===

Among domestic cats, males are more likely to fight than females",0
" Among feral cats, the most common reason for cat fighting is competition between two males to mate with a female",0
" In such cases, most fights are won by the heavier male",0
 Another common reason for fighting in domestic cats is the difficulty of establishing territories within a small home,0
 Female cats also fight over territory or to defend their kittens,0
" Neutering will decrease or eliminate this behavior in many cases, suggesting that the behavior is linked to sex hormones",0
"When cats become aggressive, they try to make themselves appear larger and more threatening by raising their fur, arching their backs, turning sideways and hissing or spitting",0
" Often, the ears are pointed down and back to avoid damage to the inner ear and potentially listen for any changes behind them while focused forward",0
 Cats may also vocalize loudly and bare their teeth in an effort to further intimidate their opponents,0
 Fights usually consist of grappling and delivering powerful slaps to the face and body with the forepaws as well as bites,0
 Cats also throw themselves to the ground in a defensive posture to rake their opponent's belly with their powerful hind legs,0
"Serious damage is rare, as the fights are usually short in duration, with the loser running away with little more than a few scratches to the face and ears",0
 Fights for mating rights are typically more severe and injuries may include deep puncture wounds and lacerations,0
" Normally, serious injuries from fighting are limited to infections of scratches and bites, though these can occasionally kill cats if untreated",0
" In addition, bites are probably the main route of transmission of feline immunodeficiency virus",0
" Sexually active males are usually involved in many fights during their lives, and often have decidedly battered faces with obvious scars and cuts to their ears and nose",0
" Cats are willing to threaten animals larger than them to defend their territory, such as dogs and foxes",0
"


=== Hunting and feeding ===

The shape and structure of cats' cheeks is insufficient to allow them to take in liquids using suction",0
" Therefore, when drinking they lap with the tongue to draw liquid upward into their mouths",0
" Lapping at a rate of four times a second, the cat touches the smooth tip of its tongue to the surface of the water, and quickly retracts it like a corkscrew, drawing water upward",0
Feral cats and free-fed house cats consume several small meals in a day,0
 The frequency and size of meals varies between individuals,0
" They select food based on its temperature, smell and texture; they dislike chilled foods and respond most strongly to moist foods rich in amino acids, which are similar to meat",0
 Cats reject novel flavors (a response termed neophobia) and learn quickly to avoid foods that have tasted unpleasant in the past,0
" It is also a common misconception that cats like milk/cream, as they tend to avoid sweet food and milk",0
 Most adult cats are lactose intolerant; the sugar in milk is not easily digested and may cause soft stools or diarrhea,0
" Some also develop odd eating habits and like to eat or chew on things like wool, plastic, cables, paper, string, aluminum foil, or even coal",0
" This condition, pica, can threaten their health, depending on the amount and toxicity of the items eaten",0
"Cats hunt small prey, primarily birds and rodents, and are often used as a form of pest control",0
" Cats use two hunting strategies, either stalking prey actively, or waiting in ambush until an animal comes close enough to be captured",0
" The strategy used depends on the prey species in the area, with cats waiting in ambush outside burrows, but tending to actively stalk birds",0
": 153  Domestic cats are a major predator of wildlife in the United States, killing an estimated 1",0
3 to 4,0
0 billion birds and 6,0
3 to 22,0
3 billion mammals annually,0
"Certain species appear more susceptible than others; in one English village, for example, 30% of house sparrow mortality was linked to the domestic cat",0
" In the recovery of ringed robins (Erithacus rubecula) and dunnocks (Prunella modularis) in Britain, 31% of deaths were a result of cat predation",0
" In parts of North America, the presence of larger carnivores such as coyotes which prey on cats and other small predators reduces the effect of predation by cats and other small predators such as opossums and raccoons on bird numbers and variety",0
"Perhaps the best-known element of cats' hunting behavior, which is commonly misunderstood and often appalls cat owners because it looks like torture, is that cats often appear to ""play"" with prey by releasing and recapturing it",0
 This cat and mouse behavior is due to an instinctive imperative to ensure that the prey is weak enough to be killed without endangering the cat,0
Another poorly understood element of cat hunting behavior is the presentation of prey to human guardians,0
" One explanation is that cats adopt humans into their social group and share excess kill with others in the group according to the dominance hierarchy, in which humans are reacted to as if they are at or near the top",0
" Another explanation is that they attempt to teach their guardians to hunt or to help their human as if feeding ""an elderly cat, or an inept kitten""",0
" This hypothesis is inconsistent with the fact that male cats also bring home prey, despite males having negligible involvement in raising kittens",0
": 153 


=== Play ===

Domestic cats, especially young kittens, are known for their love of play",0
" This behavior mimics hunting and is important in helping kittens learn to stalk, capture, and kill prey",0
" Cats also engage in play fighting, with each other and with humans",0
" This behavior may be a way for cats to practice the skills needed for real combat, and might also reduce any fear they associate with launching attacks on other animals",0
Cats also tend to play with toys more when they are hungry,0
" Owing to the close similarity between play and hunting, cats prefer to play with objects that resemble prey, such as small furry toys that move rapidly, but rapidly lose interest",0
 They become habituated to a toy they have played with before,0
" String is often used as a toy, but if it is eaten, it can become caught at the base of the cat's tongue and then move into the intestines, a medical emergency which can cause serious illness, even death",0
" Owing to the risks posed by cats eating string, it is sometimes replaced with a laser pointer's dot, which cats may chase",0
"


=== Reproduction ===

Female cats, called queens, are polyestrous with several estrus cycles during a year, lasting usually 21 days",0
 They are usually ready to mate between early February and August,0
"Several males, called tomcats, are attracted to a female in heat",0
" They fight over her, and the victor wins the right to mate",0
" At first, the female rejects the male, but eventually, the female allows the male to mate",0
" The female utters a loud yowl as the male pulls out of her because a male cat's penis has a band of about 120–150 backward-pointing penile spines, which are about 1 mm (1⁄32 in) long; upon withdrawal of the penis, the spines may provide the female with increased sexual stimulation, which acts to induce ovulation",0
"

After mating, the female cleans her vulva thoroughly",0
" If a male attempts to mate with her at this point, the female attacks him",0
" After about 20 to 30 minutes, once the female is finished grooming, the cycle will repeat",0
" Because ovulation is not always triggered by a single mating, females may not be impregnated by the first male with which they mate",0
" Furthermore, cats are superfecund; that is, a female may mate with more than one male when she is in heat, with the result that different kittens in a litter may have different fathers",0
The morula forms 124 hours after conception,0
" At 148 hours, early blastocysts form",0
" At 10–12 days, implantation occurs",0
" The gestation of queens lasts between 64 and 67 days, with an average of 65 days",0
"

Data on the reproductive capacity of more than 2,300 free-ranging queens were collected during a study between May 1998 and October 2000",0
" They had one to six kittens per litter, with an average of three kittens",0
 They produced a mean of 1,0
"4 litters per year, but a maximum of three litters in a year",0
" Of 169 kittens, 127 died before they were six months old due to a trauma caused in most cases by dog attacks and road accidents",0
"
The first litter is usually smaller than subsequent litters",0
 Kittens are weaned between six and seven weeks of age,0
" Queens normally reach sexual maturity at 5–10 months, and males at 5–7 months",0
 This varies depending on breed,0
 Kittens reach puberty at the age of 9–10 months,0
"Cats are ready to go to new homes at about 12 weeks of age, when they are ready to leave their mother",0
 They can be surgically sterilized (spayed or castrated) as early as seven weeks to limit unwanted reproduction,0
" This surgery also prevents undesirable sex-related behavior, such as aggression, territory marking (spraying urine) in males and yowling (calling) in females",0
" Traditionally, this surgery was performed at around six to nine months of age, but it is increasingly being performed before puberty, at about three to six months",0
" In the United States, about 80% of household cats are neutered",0
"


== Lifespan and health ==

The average lifespan of pet cats has risen in recent decades",0
" In the early 1980s, it was about seven years,: 33  rising to 9",0
4 years in 1995: 33  and about 15 years in 2021,0
" Some cats have been reported as surviving into their 30s, with the oldest known cat, Creme Puff, dying at a verified age of 38",0
"Neutering increases life expectancy: one study found castrated male cats live twice as long as intact males, while spayed female cats live 62% longer than intact females",0
": 35  Having a cat neutered confers health benefits, because castrated males cannot develop testicular cancer, spayed females cannot develop uterine or ovarian cancer, and both have a reduced risk of mammary cancer",0
"


=== Disease ===

About 250 heritable genetic disorders have been identified in cats, many similar to human inborn errors of metabolism",0
" The high level of similarity among the metabolism of mammals allows many of these feline diseases to be diagnosed using genetic tests that were originally developed for use in humans, as well as the use of cats as animal models in the study of the human diseases",0
" Diseases affecting domestic cats include acute infections, parasitic infestations, injuries, and chronic diseases such as kidney disease, thyroid disease, and arthritis",0
" Vaccinations are available for many infectious diseases, as are treatments to eliminate parasites such as worms, ticks, and fleas",0
"


== Ecology ==


=== Habitats ===
The domestic cat is a cosmopolitan species and occurs across much of the world",0
" It is adaptable and now present on all continents except Antarctica, and on 118 of the 131 main groups of islands, even on the isolated Kerguelen Islands",0
" Due to its ability to thrive in almost any terrestrial habitat, it is among the world's most invasive species",0
 It lives on small islands with no human inhabitants,0
" Feral cats can live in forests, grasslands, tundra, coastal areas, agricultural land, scrublands, urban areas, and wetlands",0
The unwantedness that leads to the domestic cat being treated as an invasive species is twofold,0
" On one hand, as it is little altered from the wildcat, it can readily interbreed with the wildcat",0
" This hybridization poses a danger to the genetic distinctiveness of some wildcat populations, particularly in Scotland and Hungary, possibly also the Iberian Peninsula, and where protected natural areas are close to human-dominated landscapes, such as Kruger National Park in South Africa",0
" On the other hand, and perhaps more obviously, its introduction to places where no native felines are present contributes to the decline of native species",0
"


=== Ferality ===

Feral cats are domestic cats that were born in or have reverted to a wild state",0
 They are unfamiliar with and wary of humans and roam freely in urban and rural areas,0
" The numbers of feral cats is not known, but estimates of the United States feral population range from 25 to 60 million",0
" Feral cats may live alone, but most are found in large colonies, which occupy a specific territory and are usually associated with a source of food",0
" Famous feral cat colonies are found in Rome around the Colosseum and Forum Romanum, with cats at some of these sites being fed and given medical attention by volunteers",0
"Public attitudes toward feral cats vary widely, from seeing them as free-ranging pets to regarding them as vermin",0
"Some feral cats can be successfully socialized and 're-tamed' for adoption; young cats, especially kittens and cats that have had prior experience and contact with humans are the most receptive to these efforts",0
"


=== Impact on wildlife ===

On islands, birds can contribute as much as 60% of a cat's diet",0
" In nearly all cases, the cat cannot be identified as the sole cause for reducing the numbers of island birds, and in some instances, eradication of cats has caused a ""mesopredator release"" effect; where the suppression of top carnivores creates an abundance of smaller predators that cause a severe decline in their shared prey",0
" Domestic cats are a contributing factor to the decline of many species, a factor that has ultimately led, in some cases, to extinction",0
" The South Island piopio, Chatham rail, and the New Zealand merganser are a few from a long list, with the most extreme case being the flightless Lyall's wren, which was driven to extinction only a few years after its discovery",0
"
One feral cat in New Zealand killed 102 New Zealand lesser short-tailed bats in seven days",0
" In the US, feral and free-ranging domestic cats kill an estimated 6",0
3 – 22,0
3 billion mammals annually,0
"In Australia, the impact of cats on mammal populations is even greater than the impact of habitat loss",0
" More than one million reptiles are killed by feral cats each day, representing 258 species",0
 Cats have contributed to the extinction of the Navassa curly-tailed lizard and Chioninia coctei,0
"


== Interaction with humans ==

Cats are common pets throughout the world, and their worldwide population as of 2007 exceeded 500 million",0
" Cats have been used for millennia to control rodents, notably around grain stores and aboard ships, and both uses extend to the present day",0
"As well as being kept as pets, cats are also used in the international fur trade and leather industries for making coats, hats, blankets, and stuffed toys; and shoes, gloves, and musical instruments respectively (about 24 cats are needed to make a cat-fur coat)",0
 This use has been outlawed in the United States since 2000 and in the European Union (as well as the United Kingdom) since 2007,0
"Cat pelts have been used for superstitious purposes as part of the practice of witchcraft, and are still made into blankets in Switzerland as traditional medicine thought to cure rheumatism",0
"A few attempts to build a cat census have been made over the years, both through associations or national and international organizations (such as that of the Canadian Federation of Humane Societies) and over the Internet, but such a task does not seem simple to achieve",0
 General estimates for the global population of domestic cats range widely from anywhere between 200 million to 600 million,0
" Walter Chandoha made his career photographing cats after his 1949 images of Loco, an especially charming stray taken in, were published around the world",0
" He is reported to have photographed 90,000 cats during his career and maintained an archive of 225,000 images that he drew from for publications during his lifetime",0
"


=== Shows ===

A cat show is a judged event in which the owners of cats compete to win titles in various cat-registering organizations by entering their cats to be judged after a breed standard",0
 It is often required that a cat must be healthy and vaccinated in order to participate in a cat show,0
" Both pedigreed and non-purebred companion (""moggy"") cats are admissible, although the rules differ depending on the organization",0
" Competing cats are compared to the applicable breed standard, and assessed for temperament",0
"


=== Infection ===

Cats can be infected or infested with viruses, bacteria, fungus, protozoans, arthropods or worms that can transmit diseases to humans",0
" In some cases, the cat exhibits no symptoms of the disease",0
 The same disease can then become evident in a human,0
 The likelihood that a person will become diseased depends on the age and immune status of the person,0
 Humans who have cats living in their home or in close association are more likely to become infected,0
 Others might also acquire infections from cat feces and parasites exiting the cat's body,0
" Some of the infections of most concern include salmonella, cat-scratch disease and toxoplasmosis",0
"


=== History and mythology ===

In ancient Egypt, cats were worshipped, and the goddess Bastet often depicted in cat form, sometimes taking on the war-like aspect of a lioness",0
" The Greek historian Herodotus reported that killing a cat was forbidden, and when a household cat died, the entire family mourned and shaved their eyebrows",0
" Families took their dead cats to the sacred city of Bubastis, where they were embalmed and buried in sacred repositories",0
" Herodotus expressed astonishment at the domestic cats in Egypt, because he had only ever seen wildcats",0
"Ancient Greeks and Romans kept weasels as pets, which were seen as the ideal rodent-killers",0
" The earliest unmistakable evidence of the Greeks having domestic cats comes from two coins from Magna Graecia dating to the mid-fifth century BC showing Iokastos and Phalanthos, the legendary founders of Rhegion and Taras respectively, playing with their pet cats",0
" The usual ancient Greek word for 'cat' was ailouros, meaning 'thing with the waving tail'",0
 Cats are rarely mentioned in ancient Greek literature,0
" Aristotle remarked in his History of Animals that ""female cats are naturally lecherous",0
""" The Greeks later syncretized their own goddess Artemis with the Egyptian goddess Bastet, adopting Bastet's associations with cats and ascribing them to Artemis",0
" In Ovid's Metamorphoses, when the deities flee to Egypt and take animal forms, the goddess Diana turns into a cat",0
Cats eventually displaced weasels as the pest control of choice because they were more pleasant to have around the house and were more enthusiastic hunters of mice,0
" During the Middle Ages, many of Artemis's associations with cats were grafted onto the Virgin Mary",0
" Cats are often shown in icons of Annunciation and of the Holy Family and, according to Italian folklore, on the same night that Mary gave birth to Jesus, a cat in Bethlehem gave birth to a kitten",0
" Domestic cats were spread throughout much of the rest of the world during the Age of Discovery, as ships' cats were carried on sailing ships to control shipboard rodents and as good-luck charms",0
"Several ancient religions believed cats are exalted souls, companions or guides for humans, that are all-knowing but mute so they cannot influence decisions made by humans",0
" In Japan, the maneki neko cat is a symbol of good fortune",0
" In Norse mythology, Freyja, the goddess of love, beauty, and fertility, is depicted as riding a chariot drawn by cats",0
" In Jewish legend, the first cat was living in the house of the first man Adam as a pet that got rid of mice",0
 The cat was once partnering with the first dog before the latter broke an oath they had made which resulted in enmity between the descendants of these two animals,0
" It is also written that neither cats nor foxes are represented in the water, while every other animal has an incarnation species in the water",0
" Although no species are sacred in Islam, cats are revered by Muslims",0
" Some Western writers have stated Muhammad had a favorite cat, Muezza",0
" He is reported to have loved cats so much, ""he would do without his cloak rather than disturb one that was sleeping on it""",0
" The story has no origin in early Muslim writers, and seems to confuse a story of a later Sufi saint, Ahmed ar-Rifa'i, centuries after Muhammad",0
" One of the companions of Muhammad was known as Abu Hurayrah (""father of the kitten""), in reference to his documented affection to cats",0
"


=== Superstitions and rituals ===

Many cultures have negative superstitions about cats",0
" An example would be the belief that encountering a black cat (""crossing one's path"") leads to bad luck, or that cats are witches' familiars used to augment a witch's powers and skills",0
" The killing of cats in Medieval Ypres, Belgium, is commemorated in the innocuous present-day Kattenstoet (cat parade)",0
" In mid-16th century France, cats would be burnt alive as a form of entertainment",0
" According to Norman Davies, the assembled people ""shrieked with laughter as the animals, howling with pain, were singed, roasted, and finally carbonized""",0
"James Frazer wrote that ""It was the custom to burn a basket, barrel, or sack full of live cats, which was hung from a tall mast in the midst of the bonfire; sometimes a fox was burned",0
" The people collected the embers and ashes of the fire and took them home, believing that they brought good luck",0
 The French kings often witnessed these spectacles and even lit the bonfire with their own hands,0
" In 1648 Louis XIV, crowned with a wreath of roses and carrying a bunch of roses in his hand, kindled the fire, danced at it and partook of the banquet afterwards in the town hall",0
 But this was the last occasion when a monarch presided at the midsummer bonfire in Paris,0
" At Metz midsummer fires were lighted with great pomp on the esplanade, and a dozen cats, enclosed in wicker cages, were burned alive in them, to the amusement of the people",0
" Similarly, at Gap, in the department of the Hautes-Alpes, cats used to be roasted over the midsummer bonfire",0
"""According to a myth in many cultures, cats have multiple lives",0
" In many countries, they are believed to have nine lives, but in Italy, Germany, Greece, Brazil and some Spanish-speaking regions, they are said to have seven lives, while in Arabic traditions, the number of lives is six",0
" An early mention of the myth can be found in John Heywood's The Proverbs of John Heywood (1546):

Husband, (quoth she), ye studie, be merrie now,And even as ye thinke now, so come to yow",0
"Nay not so, (quoth he), for my thought to tell right,I thinke how you lay groning, wife, all last night",0
"Husband, a groning horse and a groning wifeNever faile their master, (quoth she), for my life",0
"No wife, a woman hath nine lives like a cat",0
"
The myth is attributed to the natural suppleness and swiftness cats exhibit to escape life-threatening situations",0
" Also lending credence to this myth is the fact that falling cats often land on their feet, using an instinctive righting reflex to twist their bodies around",0
" Nonetheless, cats can still be injured or killed by a high fall",0
"

 120The dog (Canis familiaris or Canis lupus familiaris) is a domesticated descendant of the wolf,0
" Also called the domestic dog, it is derived from the extinct Pleistocene wolf, and the modern wolf is the dog's nearest living relative",0
" Dogs were the first species to be domesticated by hunter-gatherers over 15,000 years ago before the development of agriculture",0
" Due to their long association with humans, dogs have expanded to a large number of domestic individuals and gained the ability to thrive on a starch-rich diet that would be inadequate for other canids",0
"The dog has been selectively bred over millennia for various behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes",0
" Dog breeds vary widely in shape, size, and color",0
" They perform many roles for humans, such as hunting, herding, pulling loads, protection, assisting police and the military, companionship, therapy, and aiding disabled people",0
" Over the millennia, dogs became uniquely adapted to human behavior, and the human–canine bond has been a topic of frequent study",0
" This influence on human society has given them the sobriquet of ""man's best friend""",0
"


== Taxonomy ==

In 1758, the Swedish botanist and zoologist Carl Linnaeus published in his Systema Naturae, the two-word naming of species (binomial nomenclature)",0
" Canis is the Latin word meaning ""dog"", and under this genus, he listed the domestic dog, the wolf, and the golden jackal",0
" He classified the domestic dog as Canis familiaris and, on the next page, classified the grey wolf as Canis lupus",0
" Linnaeus considered the dog to be a separate species from the wolf because of its upturning tail (cauda recurvata), which is not found in any other canid",0
"In 1999, a study of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) indicated that the domestic dog may have originated from the grey wolf, with the dingo and New Guinea singing dog breeds having developed at a time when human communities were more isolated from each other",0
" In the third edition of Mammal Species of the World published in 2005, the mammalogist W",0
" Christopher Wozencraft listed under the wolf Canis lupus its wild subspecies and proposed two additional subspecies, which formed the domestic dog clade: familiaris, as named by Linnaeus in 1758 and, dingo named by Meyer in 1793",0
 Wozencraft included hallstromi (the New Guinea singing dog) as another name (junior synonym) for the dingo,0
 Wozencraft referred to the mtDNA study as one of the guides informing his decision,0
" Mammalogists have noted the inclusion of familiaris and dingo together under the ""domestic dog"" clade with some debating it",0
"In 2019, a workshop hosted by the IUCN/Species Survival Commission's Canid Specialist Group considered the dingo and the New Guinea singing dog to be feral Canis familiaris and therefore did not assess them for the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species",0
"


== Evolution ==

The Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event occurred 66 million years ago and brought an end to the non-avian dinosaurs and the appearance of the first carnivorans",0
 The name carnivoran is given to a member of the order Carnivora,0
" Carnivorans possess a common arrangement of teeth called carnassials, in which the first lower molar and the last upper premolar possess blade-like enamel crowns that act similar to a pair of shears for cutting meat",0
" This dental arrangement has been modified by adaptation over the past 60 million years for diets composed of meat, for crushing vegetation, or for the loss of the carnassial function altogether as in seals, sea lions, and walruses",0
" Today, not all carnivorans are carnivores, such as the insect-eating aardwolf",0
The carnivoran ancestors of the dog-like caniforms and the cat-like feliforms began their separate evolutionary paths just after the end of the dinosaurs,0
" The first members of the dog family Canidae appeared 40 million years ago, of which only its subfamily the Caninae survives today in the form of the wolf-like and fox-like canines",0
" Within the Caninae, the first members of genus Canis appeared six million years ago, the ancestors of modern domestic dogs, wolves, coyotes, and golden jackals",0
"


=== Domestication ===

The earliest remains generally accepted to be those of a domesticated dog were discovered in Bonn-Oberkassel, Germany",0
" Contextual, isotopic, genetic, and morphological evidence shows that this dog was not a local wolf",0
" The dog was dated to 14,223 years ago and was found buried along with a man and a woman, all three having been sprayed with red hematite powder and buried under large, thick basalt blocks",0
 The dog had died of canine distemper,0
" Earlier remains dating back to 30,000 years ago have been described as Paleolithic dogs, but their status as dogs or wolves remains debated because considerable morphological diversity existed among wolves during the Late Pleistocene",0
"This timing indicates that the dog was the first species to be domesticated in the time of hunter–gatherers, which predates agriculture",0
" DNA sequences show that all ancient and modern dogs share a common ancestry and descended from an ancient, extinct wolf population which was distinct from the modern wolf lineage",0
" Most dogs form a sister group to the remains of a Late Pleistocene wolf found in the Kessleroch cave near Thayngen in the canton of Schaffhausen, Switzerland, which dates to 14,500 years ago",0
" The most recent common ancestor of both is estimated to be from 32,100 years ago",0
" This indicates that an extinct Late Pleistocene wolf may have been the ancestor of the dog, with the modern wolf being the dog's nearest living relative",0
The dog is a classic example of a domestic animal that likely travelled a commensal pathway into domestication,0
 The questions of when and where dogs were first domesticated have taxed geneticists and archaeologists for decades,0
" Genetic studies suggest a domestication process commencing over 25,000 years ago, in one or several wolf populations in either Europe, the high Arctic, or eastern Asia",0
" In 2021, a literature review of the current evidence  infers that the dog was domesticated in Siberia 23,000 years ago by ancient North Siberians, then later dispersed eastward into the Americas and westward across Eurasia",0
"


=== Breeds ===

Dogs are the most variable mammal on earth with around 450 globally recognized dog breeds",0
" In the Victorian era, directed human selection developed the modern dog breeds, which resulted in a vast range of phenotypes",0
" Most breeds were derived from small numbers of founders within the last 200 years, and since then dogs have undergone rapid phenotypic change and were formed into today's modern breeds due to artificial selection imposed by humans",0
" The skull, body, and limb proportions vary significantly between breeds, with dogs displaying more phenotypic diversity than can be found within the entire order of carnivores",0
" These breeds possess distinct traits related to morphology, which include body size, skull shape, tail phenotype, fur type and colour",0
" Their behavioural traits include guarding, herding, and hunting, retrieving, and scent detection",0
" Their personality traits include hypersocial behavior, boldness, and aggression, which demonstrates the functional and behavioral diversity of dogs",0
" As a result, present day dogs are the most abundant carnivore species and are dispersed around the world",0
 The most striking example of this dispersal is that of the numerous modern breeds of European lineage during the Victorian era,0
"


== Biology ==


=== Anatomy ===


==== Skeleton ====

All healthy dogs, regardless of their size and type, have an identical skeletal structure with the exception of the number of bones in the tail, although there is significant skeletal variation between dogs of different types",0
" The dog's skeleton is well adapted for running; the vertebrae on the neck and back have extensions for powerful back muscles to connect to, the long ribs provide plenty of room for the heart and lungs, and the shoulders are unattached to the skeleton allowing great flexibility",0
"Compared to the dog's wolf-like ancestors, selective breeding since domestication has seen the dog's skeleton greatly enhanced in size for larger types as mastiffs and miniaturised for smaller types such as terriers; dwarfism has been selectively utilised for some types where short legs are advantageous such as dachshunds and corgis",0
" Most dogs naturally have 26 vertebrae in their tails, but some with naturally short tails have as few as three",0
"The dog's skull has identical components regardless of breed type, but there is significant divergence in terms of skull shape between types",0
" The three basic skull shapes are the elongated dolichocephalic type as seen in sighthounds, the intermediate mesocephalic or mesaticephalic type, and the very short and broad brachycephalic type exemplified by mastiff type skulls",0
"


==== Senses ====

A dog's senses include vision, hearing, smell, taste, touch",0
 One study suggested that dogs can feel Earth's magnetic field,0
"


==== Coat ====

The coats of domestic dogs are of two varieties: ""double"" being familiar with dogs (as well as wolves) originating from colder climates, made up of a coarse guard hair and a soft down hair, or ""single"", with the topcoat only",0
" Breeds may have an occasional ""blaze"", stripe, or ""star"" of white fur on their chest or underside",0
" Premature graying can occur in dogs from as early as one year of age; this is associated with impulsive behaviors, anxiety behaviors, fear of noise, and fear of unfamiliar people or animals",0
"


==== Tail ====
There are many different shapes for dog tails: straight, straight up, sickle, curled, or corkscrew",0
" As with many canids, one of the primary functions of a dog's tail is to communicate their emotional state, which can be crucial in getting along with others",0
 In some hunting dogs the tail is traditionally docked to avoid injuries,0
"


=== Health ===

Some breeds of dogs are prone to specific genetic ailments such as elbow and hip dysplasia, blindness, deafness, pulmonic stenosis, cleft palate, and trick knees",0
" Two severe medical conditions significantly affecting dogs are pyometra, affecting unspayed females of all breeds and ages, and Gastric dilatation volvulus (bloat), which affects larger breeds or deep-chested dogs",0
 Both of these are acute conditions and can kill rapidly,0
" Dogs are also susceptible to parasites such as fleas, ticks, mites, hookworms, tapeworms, roundworms, and heartworms, which is a roundworm species that lives in the hearts of dogs",0
"
Several human foods and household ingestible are toxic to dogs, including chocolate solids, causing theobromine poisoning, onions and garlic, causing thiosulphate, sulfoxide or disulfide poisoning, grapes and raisins, macadamia nuts, and xylitol",0
 The nicotine in tobacco can also be dangerous to dogs,0
 Signs of ingestion can include copious vomiting (e,0
g,0
", from eating cigar butts) or diarrhea",0
" Some other symptoms are abdominal pain, loss of coordination, collapse, or death",0
"Dogs are also vulnerable to some of the same health conditions as humans, including diabetes, dental and heart disease, epilepsy, cancer, hypothyroidism, and arthritis",0
"


==== Lifespan ====

The typical lifespan of dogs varies widely among breeds, but for most, the median longevity (the age at which half the dogs in a population have died and half are still alive) ranges from 10 to 13 years",0
" The median longevity of mixed-breed dogs, taken as an average of all sizes, is one or more years longer than that of purebred dogs when all breeds are averaged",0
" For dogs in England, increased body weight has been found to be negatively correlated with longevity (i",0
e,0
", the heavier the dog, the shorter its lifespan), and mixed-breed dogs live on average 1",0
2 years longer than purebred dogs,0
"


=== Reproduction ===

In domestic dogs, sexual maturity happens around six months to one year for both males and females, although this can be delayed until up to two years of age for some large breeds, and is the time at which female dogs will have their first estrous cycle",0
" They will experience subsequent estrous cycles semiannually, during which the body prepares for pregnancy",0
" At the peak of the cycle, females will become estrous, mentally and physically receptive to copulation",0
" Because the ova survive and can be fertilized for a week after ovulation, more than one male can sire the same litter",0
"Fertilization typically occurs two to five days after ovulation; 14–16 days after ovulation, the embryo attaches to the uterus and after seven to eight more days, a heartbeat is detectable",0
"Dogs bear their litters roughly 58 to 68 days after fertilization, with an average of 63 days, although the length of gestation can vary",0
 An average litter consists of about six puppies,0
"


==== Neutering ====
Neutering is the sterilization of animals, usually by removing the male's testicles or the female's ovaries and uterus, to eliminate the ability to procreate and reduce sex drive",0
" Because of dogs' overpopulation in some countries, many animal control agencies, such as the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA), advise that dogs not intended for further breeding should be neutered, so that they do not have undesired puppies that may later be euthanized",0
"According to the Humane Society of the United States, three to four million dogs and cats are euthanized each year",0
 Many more are confined to cages in shelters because there are many more animals than there are homes,0
 Spaying or castrating dogs helps keep overpopulation down,0
"Neutering reduces problems caused by hypersexuality, especially in male dogs",0
" Spayed female dogs are less likely to develop cancers affecting the mammary glands, ovaries, and other reproductive organs",0
" However, neutering increases the risk of urinary incontinence in female dogs and prostate cancer in males and osteosarcoma, hemangiosarcoma, cruciate ligament rupture, obesity, and diabetes mellitus in either sex",0
"


=== Inbreeding depression ===
A common breeding practice for pet dogs is mating between close relatives (e",0
g,0
", between half and full siblings)",0
 Inbreeding depression is considered to be due mainly to the expression of homozygous deleterious recessive mutations,0
" Outcrossing between unrelated individuals, including dogs of different breeds, results in the beneficial masking of deleterious recessive mutations in progeny",0
"In a study of seven dog breeds (the Bernese Mountain Dog, Basset Hound, Cairn Terrier, Brittany, German Shepherd Dog, Leonberger, and West Highland White Terrier), it was found that inbreeding decreases litter size and survival",0
" Another analysis of data on 42,855 Dachshund litters found that as the inbreeding coefficient increased, litter size decreased and the percentage of stillborn puppies increased, thus indicating inbreeding depression",0
" In a study of Boxer litters, 22% of puppies died before reaching 7 weeks of age",0
" Stillbirth was the most frequent cause of death, followed by infection",0
 Mortality due to infection increased significantly with increases in inbreeding,0
"


== Behavior ==

Dog behavior is the internally coordinated responses (actions or inactions) of the domestic dog (individuals or groups) to internal and external stimuli",0
" As the oldest domesticated species, dogs' minds inevitably have been shaped by millennia of contact with humans",0
" As a result of this physical and social evolution, dogs have acquired the ability to understand and communicate with humans more than any other species and they are uniquely attuned to human behaviors",0
 Behavioral scientists have uncovered a surprising set of social-cognitive abilities in domestic dogs,0
" These abilities are not possessed by the dog's closest canine relatives or other highly intelligent mammals, such as great apes, but rather parallel to children's social-cognitive skills",0
"Unlike other domestic species selected for production-related traits, dogs were initially selected for their behaviors",0
" In 2016, a study found that only 11 fixed genes showed variation between wolves and dogs",0
 These gene variations were unlikely to have been the result of natural evolution and indicate selection on both morphology and behavior during dog domestication,0
" These genes have been shown to affect the catecholamine synthesis pathway, with the majority of the genes affecting the fight-or-flight response (i",0
e,0
", selection for tameness) and emotional processing",0
 Dogs generally show reduced fear and aggression compared with wolves,0
" Some of these genes have been associated with aggression in some dog breeds, indicating their importance in both the initial domestication and later in breed formation",0
" Traits of high sociability and lack of fear in dogs may include genetic modifications related to Williams-Beuren syndrome in humans, which cause hypersociability at the expense of problem-solving ability",0
"


=== Intelligence ===

Dog intelligence is the dog's ability to perceive information and retain it as knowledge for applying to solve problems",0
 Studies of two dogs suggest that dogs can learn by inference and have advanced memory skills,0
"  A study with Rico, a Border Collie, showed that he knew the labels of over 200 different items",0
 He inferred the names of novel things by exclusion learning and correctly retrieved those new items immediately and four weeks after the initial exposure,0
" A study of another Border Collie, Chaser, documented his learning and memory capabilities",0
" He had learned the names and could associate by verbal command over 1,000 words",0
" Dogs can read and react appropriately to human body language such as gesturing, pointing, and human voice commands",0
"
One study of canine cognitive abilities found that dogs' capabilities are no more exceptional than those of other animals, such as horses, chimpanzees, or cats",0
" One limited study of 18 household dogs found that they lacked spatial memory, and were more focused on the ""what"" of a task rather than the ""where""",0
Dogs demonstrate a theory of mind by engaging in deception,0
" An experimental study showed compelling evidence that Australian dingos can outperform domestic dogs in non-social problem-solving, indicating that domestic dogs may have lost much of their original problem-solving abilities once they joined humans",0
" Another study revealed that after undergoing training to solve a simple manipulation task, dogs faced with an unsolvable version of the same problem look at the human, while socialized wolves do not",0
"


=== Communication ===

Dog communication is how dogs convey information to other dogs, understand messages from humans and translate the information that dogs are transmitting",0
": xii  Communication behaviors of dogs include eye gaze, facial expression, vocalization, body posture (including movements of bodies and limbs), and gustatory communication (scents, pheromones, and taste)",0
" Humans communicate to dogs by using vocalization, hand signals, and body posture",0
"


== Ecology ==


=== Population ===
The dog is probably the most widely abundant large carnivoran living in the human environment",0
"
In 2013, the estimated global dog population was between 700 million and 987 million",0
 About 20% of dogs live as pets in developed countries,0
" In the developing world, dogs are typically feral or communally owned, with pet dogs uncommon",0
" Most of these dogs live their lives as scavengers and have never been owned by humans, with one study showing their most common response when approached by strangers is to run away (52%) or respond aggressively (11%)",0
" Little is known about these dogs, or the dogs in developed countries that are feral, strays, or are in shelters because the great majority of modern research on dog cognition has focused on pet dogs living in human homes",0
"


=== Competitors and predators ===
Although dogs are the most abundant and widely distributed terrestrial carnivores, feral and free-ranging dogs' potential to compete with other large carnivores is limited by their strong association with humans",0
" For example, a review of the studies in dogs' competitive effects on sympatric carnivores did not mention any research on competition between dogs and wolves",0
" Although wolves are known to kill dogs, they tend to live in pairs or in small packs in areas where they are highly persecuted, giving them a disadvantage facing large dog groups",0
Wolves kill dogs wherever they are found together,0
" In some instances, wolves have displayed an uncharacteristic fearlessness of humans and buildings when attacking dogs to the extent that they have to be beaten off or killed",0
" Although the numbers of dogs killed each year are relatively low, it induces a fear of wolves entering villages and farmyards to take dogs and losses of dogs to wolves have led to demands for more liberal wolf hunting regulations",0
Coyotes and big cats have also been known to attack dogs,0
" In particular, leopards are known to have a preference for dogs and have been recorded to kill and consume them, no matter what their size",0
 Siberian tigers in the Amur River region have killed dogs in the middle of villages,0
 This indicates that the dogs were targeted,0
" Amur tigers will not tolerate wolves as competitors within their territories, and the tigers could be considering dogs in the same way",0
 Striped hyenas are known to kill dogs in their range,0
"


=== Diet ===

Dogs have been described as omnivores",0
" Compared to wolves, dogs from agricultural societies have extra copies of amylase and other genes involved in starch digestion that contribute to an increased ability to thrive on a starch-rich diet",0
" Similar to humans, some dog breeds produce amylase in their saliva and are classified as having a high starch diet",0
" However, more like cats and less like other omnivores, dogs can only produce bile acid with taurine and they cannot produce vitamin D, which they obtain from animal flesh",0
" Also more like cats, dogs require arginine to maintain nitrogen balance",0
 These nutritional requirements place dogs halfway between carnivores and omnivores,0
"


=== Range ===
As a domesticated or semi-domesticated animal, the dog is nearly universal among human societies",0
" Notable exceptions once included:

The Aboriginal Tasmanians, who were separated from Australia before the arrival of dingos on that continent
The Andamanese peoples, who were isolated when rising sea levels covered the land bridge to Myanmar
The Fuegians, who instead domesticated the Fuegian dog, a different canid species
Individual Pacific islands whose maritime settlers did not bring dogs, or where dogs died out after original settlement, notably the Mariana Islands, Palau and most of the Caroline Islands with exceptions such as Fais Island and Nukuoro, the Marshall Islands, the Gilbert Islands, New Caledonia, Vanuatu, Tonga, Marquesas, Mangaia in the Cook Islands, Rapa Iti in French Polynesia, Easter Island, the Chatham Islands and Pitcairn Island (settled by the Bounty mutineers, who killed off their dogs to escape discovery by passing ships)",0
"Dogs were introduced to Antarctica as sled dogs, but were later outlawed by international agreement due to the possible risk of spreading infections",0
"


== Roles with humans ==
Domestic dogs inherited complex behaviors, such as bite inhibition, from their wolf ancestors, which would have been pack hunters with a complex body language",0
" These sophisticated forms of social cognition and communication may account for their trainability, playfulness and ability to fit into human households and social situations",0
 These attributes have given dogs a relationship with humans that has enabled them to become one of the most successful animals today,0
The dogs' value to early human hunter-gatherers led to them quickly becoming ubiquitous across world cultures,0
" Dogs perform many roles for people, such as hunting, herding, pulling loads, protection, assisting police and the military, companionship and aiding disabled individuals",0
" This influence on human society has given them the nickname ""man's best friend"" in the Western world",0
" In some cultures, however, dogs are also a source of meat",0
"


=== Pets ===

It is estimated that three-quarters of the world's dog population lives in the developing world as feral, village, or community dogs, with pet dogs uncommon",0
"""The most widespread form of interspecies bonding occurs between humans and dogs"" and the keeping of dogs as companions, particularly by elites, has a long history",0
 Pet dog populations grew significantly after World War II as suburbanization increased,0
" In the 1950s and 1960s, dogs were kept outside more often than they tend to be today (the expression ""in the doghouse"" - recorded since 1932 - to describe exclusion from the group implies a distance between the doghouse and the home) and were still primarily functional, acting as a guard, children's playmate, or walking companion",0
" From the 1980s, there have been changes in the pet dog's role, such as the increased role of dogs in the emotional support of their human guardians",0
 People and their dogs have become increasingly integrated and implicated in each other's lives to the point where pet dogs actively shape how a family and home are experienced,0
There have been two significant trends occurring within the second half of the 20th century in pet dogs' changing status,0
" The first has been ""commodification"", shaping it to conform to social expectations of personality and behavior",0
 The second has been the broadening of the family's concept and the home to include dogs-as-dogs within everyday routines and practices,0
A vast range of commodity forms aims to transform a pet dog into an ideal companion,0
" The list of goods, services, and places available is enormous: from dog perfumes, couture, furniture and housing to dog groomers, therapists, trainers and caretakers, dog cafes, spas, parks and beaches and dog hotels, airlines and cemeteries",0
" Dog training books, classes, and television programs proliferated as the process of commodifying the pet dog continued",0
"The majority of contemporary dog owners describe their pet as part of the family, although some ambivalence about the relationship is evident in the popular reconceptualization of the dog-human family as a pack",0
" Some dog trainers, such as on the television program Dog Whisperer, have promoted a dominance model of dog-human relationships",0
" However, it has been disputed that ""trying to achieve status"" is characteristic of dog-human interactions",0
" The idea of the ""alpha dog"" trying to be dominant is based on a disproved theory about wolf packs",0
" Pet dogs play an active role in family life; for example, a study of conversations in dog-human families showed how family members use the dog as a resource, talking to the dog, or talking through the dog; to mediate their interactions with each other",0
"Increasingly, human family-members engage in activities centered on the dog's perceived needs and interests, or in which the dog is an integral partner, such as dog dancing and dog yoga",0
"According to statistics published by the American Pet Products Manufacturers Association in the National Pet Owner Survey in 2009–2010, an estimated 77",0
5 million people in the United States have pet dogs,0
" The same source shows that nearly 40% of American households own at least one dog, of which 67% own just one dog, 25% two dogs and nearly 9% more than two dogs",0
" There does not seem to be any gender preference among dogs as pets, as the statistical data reveal an equal number of male and female pet dogs",0
" Although several programs promote pet adoption, less than one-fifth of the owned dogs come from shelters",0
A study using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to compare humans and dogs showed that dogs have the same response to voices and use the same parts of the brain as humans do,0
" This gives dogs the ability to recognize human emotional sounds, making them friendly social pets to humans",0
"


=== Workers ===
Dogs have lived and worked with humans in many roles",0
" In addition to dogs' role as companion animals, dogs have been bred for herding livestock (collies, sheepdogs),  hunting (hounds, pointers) and rodent control (terriers)",0
" Other types of working dogs include search and rescue dogs, detection dogs trained to detect illicit drugs or chemical weapons; guard dogs; dogs who assist fishermen with the use of nets; and dogs that pull loads",0
" In 1957, the dog Laika became the first animal to be launched into Earth orbit, aboard the Soviets' Sputnik 2; she died during the flight",0
"Various kinds of service dogs and assistance dogs, including guide dogs, hearing dogs, mobility assistance dogs and psychiatric service dogs, assist individuals with disabilities",0
" Some dogs owned by people with epilepsy have been shown to alert their handler when the handler shows signs of an impending seizure, sometimes well in advance of onset, allowing the guardian to seek safety, medication, or medical care",0
"


=== Athletes and models ===

People often enter their dogs in competitions, such as breed-conformation shows or sports, including racing, sledding and agility competitions",0
" In conformation shows, also referred to as breed shows, a judge familiar with the specific dog breed evaluates individual purebred dogs for conformity with their established breed type as described in the breed standard",0
" As the breed standard only deals with the dog's externally observable qualities (such as appearance, movement and temperament), separately tested qualities (such as ability or health) are not part of the judging in conformation shows",0
"


=== Food ===

Dog meat is consumed in some East Asian countries, including Korea, China, Vietnam and the Philippines, which dates back to antiquity",0
" Based on limited data, it is estimated that 13–16 million dogs are killed and consumed in Asia every year",0
" In China, debates have ensued over banning the consumption of dog meat",0
"  Following the Sui and Tang dynasties of the first millennium, however, people living on northern China's plains began to eschew eating dogs, which is likely due to Buddhism and Islam's spread, two religions that forbade the consumption of certain animals, including the dog",0
" As members of the upper classes shunned dog meat, it gradually became a social taboo to eat it, even though the general population continued to consume it for centuries afterward",0
 Dog meat is also consumed in some parts of Switzerland,0
" Other cultures, such as Polynesia and pre-Columbian Mexico, also consumed dog meat in their history",0
 Dog fat is also reportedly believed to be beneficial for the lungs in some parts of Poland and Central Asia,0
 Proponents of eating dog meat have argued that placing a distinction between livestock and dogs is Western hypocrisy and that there is no difference in eating different animals' meat,0
"In Korea, the primary dog breed raised for meat, the Nureongi, differs from those breeds raised for pets that Koreans may keep in their homes",0
"The most popular Korean dog dish is called bosintang, a spicy stew meant to balance the body's heat during the summer months",0
" Followers of the custom claim this is done to ensure good health by balancing one's gi, or the body's vital energy",0
 A 19th-century version of bosintang explains that the dish is prepared by boiling dog meat with scallions and chili powder,0
 Variations of the dish contain chicken and bamboo shoots,0
" While the dishes are still prevalent in Korea with a segment of the population, dog is not as widely consumed as beef, pork and chicken",0
"


=== Health risks ===

In 2018, the WHO reported that 59,000 people died globally from rabies, with 59",0
6% in Asia and 36,0
4% in Africa,0
 Rabies is a disease for which dogs are the most important vector,0
 Significant dog bites affect tens of millions of people globally each year,0
" Children in mid-to-late childhood are the largest percentage bitten by dogs, with a greater risk of injury to the head and neck",0
 They are more likely to need medical treatment and have the highest death rate,0
 Sharp claws with powerful muscles behind them can lacerate flesh in a scratch that can lead to serious infections,0
In the U,0
S,0
", cats and dogs are a factor in more than 86,000 falls each year",0
 It has been estimated that around 2% of dog-related injuries treated in U,0
K,0
 hospitals are domestic accidents,0
" The same study found that while dog involvement in road traffic accidents was difficult to quantify, dog-associated road accidents involving injury more commonly involved two-wheeled vehicles",0
Toxocara canis (dog roundworm) eggs in dog feces can cause toxocariasis,0
" In the United States, about 10,000 cases of Toxocara infection are reported in humans each year, and almost 14% of the U",0
S,0
 population is infected,0
 Untreated toxocariasis can cause retinal damage and decreased vision,0
 Dog feces can also contain hookworms that cause cutaneous larva migrans in humans,0
"


=== Health benefits ===

Dogs suffer from the same common disorders as humans; these include cancer, diabetes, heart disease and neurologic disorders",0
" Their pathology is similar to humans, as is their response to treatment and their outcomes",0
" Researchers are identifying the genes associated with dog diseases similar to human disorders, but lack mouse models to find cures for both dogs and humans",0
 The genes involved in canine obsessive-compulsive disorders led to the detection of four genes in humans' related pathways,0
The scientific evidence is mixed as to whether a dog's companionship can enhance human physical health and psychological well-being,0
 Studies suggesting that there are benefits to physical health and psychological well-being have been criticized for being poorly controlled,0
" It found that ""the health of elderly people is related to their health habits and social supports but not to their ownership of, or attachment to, a companion animal",0
""" Earlier studies have shown that people who keep pet dogs or cats exhibit better mental and physical health than those who do not, making fewer visits to the doctor and being less likely to be on medication than non-guardians",0
"A 2005 paper states ""recent research has failed to support earlier findings that pet ownership is associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease, a reduced use of general practitioner services, or any psychological or physical benefits on health for community dwelling older people",0
" Research has, however, pointed to significantly less absenteeism from school through sickness among children who live with pets",0
""" In one study, new guardians reported a highly significant reduction in minor health problems during the first month following pet acquisition",0
 This effect was sustained in those with dogs through to the end of the study,0
People with pet dogs took considerably more physical exercise than those with cats and those without pets,0
" The results provide evidence that keeping pets may have positive effects on human health and behavior and that for guardians of dogs, these effects are relatively long-term",0
 Pet guardianship has also been associated with increased coronary artery disease survival,0
 Human guardians are significantly less likely to die within one year of an acute myocardial infarction than those who did not own dogs,0
 The association between dog ownership and adult physical activity levels has been reviewed by several authors,0
"The health benefits of dogs can result from contact with dogs in general, not solely from having dogs as pets",0
" For example, when in a pet dog's presence, people show reductions in cardiovascular, behavioral and psychological indicators of anxiety",0
" Other health benefits are gained from exposure to immune-stimulating microorganisms, which can protect against allergies and autoimmune diseases according to the hygiene hypothesis",0
" The benefits of contact with a dog also include social support, as dogs cannot only provide companionship and social support themselves but also act as facilitators of social interactions between humans",0
 One study indicated that wheelchair users experience more positive social interactions with strangers when accompanied by a dog than when they are not,0
" In 2015, a study found that pet owners were significantly more likely to get to know people in their neighborhood than non-pet owners",0
"Using dogs and other animals as a part of therapy dates back to the late 18th century, when animals were introduced into mental institutions to help socialize patients with mental disorders",0
" Animal-assisted intervention research has shown that animal-assisted therapy with a dog can increase social behaviors, such as smiling and laughing, among people with Alzheimer's disease",0
" One study demonstrated that children with ADHD and conduct disorders who participated in an education program with dogs and other animals showed increased attendance, increased knowledge and skill objectives and decreased antisocial and violent behavior compared with those not in an animal-assisted program",0
"


=== Cultural importance ===

Dogs were depicted to symbolize guidance, protection, loyalty, fidelity, faithfulness, alertness, and love",0
" In ancient Mesopotamia, from the Old Babylonian period until the Neo-Babylonian, dogs were the symbol of Ninisina, the goddess of healing and medicine, and her worshippers frequently dedicated small models of seated dogs to her",0
" In the Neo-Assyrian and Neo-Babylonian periods, dogs were used as emblems of magical protection",0
" In China, Korea and Japan, dogs are viewed as kind protectors",0
"In mythology, dogs often serve as pets or as watchdogs",0
 Stories of dogs guarding the gates of the underworld recur throughout Indo-European mythologies and may originate from Proto-Indo-European religion,0
" In Greek mythology, Cerberus is a three-headed, dragon-tailed watchdog who guards the gates of Hades",0
 Dogs are also associated with the Greek goddess Hecate,0
" In Norse mythology, a bloody, four-eyed dog called Garmr guards Helheim",0
" In Persian mythology, two four-eyed dogs guard the Chinvat Bridge",0
" In Welsh mythology, Annwn is guarded by Cŵn Annwn",0
" In Hindu mythology, Yama, the god of death, owns two watchdogs who have four eyes",0
 They are said to watch over the gates of Naraka,0
 A black dog is also considered to be the vahana (vehicle) of Bhairava (an incarnation of Shiva),0
"In Christianity, dogs represent faithfulness",0
" Within the Roman Catholic denomination specifically, the iconography of Saint Dominic includes a dog, after the saint's mother dreamt of a dog springing from her womb and becoming pregnant shortly after that",0
" As such, the Dominican Order (Ecclesiastical Latin: Domini canis) means ""dog of the Lord"" or ""hound of the Lord"" (Ecclesiastical Latin: Domini canis)",0
" In Christian folklore, a church grim often takes the form of a black dog to guard Christian churches and their churchyards from sacrilege",0
 Jewish law does not prohibit keeping dogs and other pets,0
 Jewish law requires Jews to feed dogs (and other animals that they own) before themselves and make arrangements for feeding them before obtaining them,0
" The view on dogs in Islam is mixed, with some schools of thought viewing it as unclean, although Khaled Abou El Fadl states that this view is based on ""pre-Islamic Arab mythology"" and ""a tradition to be falsely attributed to the Prophet",0
""" Therefore, Sunni Malaki and Hanafi jurists permit the trade of and keeping of dogs as pets",0
"

Data of the genome assembly of Canis lupus familiaris (version UU_Cfam_GSD_1",0
"0/canFam4), via NCBIA mouse (PL: mice) is a small rodent",0
" Characteristically, mice are known to have a pointed snout, small rounded ears, a body-length scaly tail, and a high breeding rate",0
 The best known mouse species is the common house mouse (Mus musculus),0
 Mice are also popular as pets,0
" In some places, certain kinds of field mice are locally common",0
 They are known to invade homes for food and shelter,0
" 
Mice are typically distinguished from rats by their size",0
" Generally, when a muroid rodent is discovered, its common name includes the term mouse if it is smaller, or rat if it is larger",0
 The common terms rat and mouse are not taxonomically specific,0
" Typical mice are classified in the genus Mus, but the term mouse is not confined to members of Mus and can also apply to species from other genera such as the deer mouse, Peromyscus",0
"
Domestic mice sold as pets often differ substantially in size from the common house mouse",0
 This is attributable to breeding and different conditions in the wild,0
 The best-known strain of mouse is the white lab mouse,0
 It has more uniform traits that are appropriate to its use in research,0
"
Cats, wild dogs, foxes, birds of prey, snakes and even certain kinds of arthropods have been known to prey heavily upon mice",0
" Despite this, mice populations remain plentiful",0
" Due to its remarkable adaptability to almost any environment, the mouse is one of the most successful mammalian genera living on Earth today",0
"
In certain contexts, mice can be considered vermin",0
" Vermin are a major source of crop damage, as they are known to cause structural damage and spread disease",0
 Mice spread disease through their feces and are often carriers of parasites,0
" In North America, breathing dust that has come in contact with mouse excrement has been linked to hantavirus, which may lead to hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS)",0
"
Primarily nocturnal animals, mice compensate for their poor eyesight with a keen sense of hearing",0
 They depend on their sense of smell to locate food and avoid predators,0
"In the wild, mice are known to build intricate burrows",0
 These burrows have long entrances and are equipped with escape tunnels,0
" In at least one species, the architectural design of a burrow is a genetic trait",0
"


== Types of animals known as mice ==
The most common mice are murines, in the same clade as common rats",0
" They are murids, along with gerbils and other close relatives",0

== Emotions ==
Researchers at the Max Planck Institute of Neurobiology have confirmed that mice have a range of facial expressions",0
" They used machine vision to spot familiar human emotions like pleasure, disgust, nausea, pain, and fear",0
"


== Diet ==
In nature, mice are largely herbivores, consuming any kind of fruit or grain from plants",0
" However, mice adapt well to urban areas and are known for eating almost all types of food scraps",0
" In captivity, mice are commonly fed commercial pelleted mouse diet",0
" These diets are nutritionally complete, but they still need a large variety of vegetables",0
"
Despite popular belief, most mice do not have a special appetite for cheese",0
 They will only eat cheese for lack of better options,0
"


== Human use ==


=== As experimental animals ===

Mice are common experimental animals in laboratory research of biology and psychology fields primarily because they are mammals, and also because they share a high degree of homology with humans",0
" They are the most commonly used mammalian model organism, more common than rats",0
" The mouse genome has been sequenced, and virtually all mouse genes have human homologs",0
 The mouse has approximately 2,0
7 billion base pairs and 20 pairs of chromosomes,0
"
They can also be manipulated in ways that are illegal with humans, although animal rights activists often object",0
 A knockout mouse is a genetically modified mouse that has had one or more of its genes made inoperable through a gene knockout,0
"
Reasons for common selection of mice are that they are small and inexpensive, have a widely varied diet, are easily maintained, and can reproduce quickly",0
 Several generations of mice can be observed in a relatively short time,0
 Mice are generally very docile if raised from birth and given sufficient human contact,0
" However, certain strains have been known to be quite temperamental",0
"


=== As pets ===

Many people buy mice as companion pets",0
" They can be playful, loving and can grow used to being handled",0
" Like pet rats, pet mice should not be left unsupervised outside as they have many natural predators, including (but not limited to) birds, snakes, lizards, cats, and dogs",0
 Male mice tend to have a stronger odor than the females,0
"  However, mice are careful groomers and as pets they never need bathing",0
  Well looked-after mice can make ideal pets,0
" Some common mouse care products are:

Cage – Usually a hamster or gerbil cage, but a variety of special mouse cages are now available",0
 Most should have a secure door,0
"
Food – Special pelleted and seed-based food is available",0
" Mice can generally eat most rodent food (for rats, mice, hamsters, gerbils, etc",0
")
Bedding – Usually made of hardwood pulp, such as aspen, sometimes from shredded, uninked paper or recycled virgin wood pulp",0
" Using corn husk bedding is avoided because it promotes Aspergillus fungus, and can grow mold once it gets wet, which is rough on their feet",0
"


=== As feed ===

Mice are a staple in the diet of many small carnivores",0
" In various countries mice are used as feed for pets such as snakes, lizards, frogs, tarantulas, and birds of prey, and many pet stores carry mice for this purpose",0
 Such mice are sold in various sizes and with various amounts of fur,0
" Mice without fur are easier for the animal to consume; however, mice with fur may be more convincing as animal feed",0
"


=== As food ===
Humans have eaten mice since prehistoric times",0
" In Victorian Britain, fried mice were still given to children as a folk remedy for bed-wetting; while Jared Diamond reports creamed mice being used in England as a dietary supplement during WW II rationing",0
" Mice are a delicacy throughout eastern Zambia and northern Malawi, where they are a seasonal source of protein",0
 Field rat is a popular food in Vietnam and neighboring countries,0
" In many countries, however, mouse is no longer a food item",0
"
Prescribed cures in Ancient Egypt included mice as medicine",0
" In Ancient Egypt, when infants were ill, mice were eaten as treatment by their mothers",0
 It was believed that mouse eating by the mother would help heal the baby who was ill,0
"

High-resolution images of cross sections of mice brains
History of the mouse (with focus on their use in genetics studies)
Mouse tracks: How to identify mouse tracksBox turtle is the common name for several species of turtle",0
" It may refer to those of the genus Cuora or Pyxidea, which are the Asian box turtles, or more commonly to species of the genus Terrapene, the North American box turtles",0
" They are largely characterized by having a shell shaped like a dome, which is hinged at the bottom, allowing the animal to close its shell tightly to escape predators",0
" Furthermore, the two genera are very different in habitat, behavior and appearance, and are not even classified in the same family",0
" Even though box turtles became very popular pets, their needs in captivity are complex and the capture of turtles can have serious detrimental effects on the wild population",0
"The box turtle commonly lives over twenty years, with verified cases of lifespans exceeding 40 to 50 years",0
 There have been unverified cases of box turtles living for a hundred years and more,0
"


== Diet ==
Box turtles are omnivorous",0
" Their eagle eyes and keen sense of smell help them find foods such as snails, insects, berries, fungi, slugs, worms, flowers, fish, frogs, salamanders, various rodents, snakes, birds, and eggs",0
 During their first five to six years of life they are primarily carnivorous,0
" Adults tend to be mostly herbivores, but do not feed on leafy greens",0
 Box turtles are known to feed on animals found dead on roadways victims of being struck by a car or other rolling vehicle,0
" Hatchlings and young turtles need more protein and prefer a carnivorous diet, to which, as they grow, they incorporate more and more plants",0
"


== Research ==
A recent study conducted by Davidson College revealed, among other things, that a box turtle can make sounds with its jaws that exceed 75 dB",0
 This sound can be used to scare away predators and even also as some kind of mating call,0
"


== Mating ==
While it appears that most matings of Terrapene carolina occur in one-on-one encounters, there are occasions when two males will compete for access to the same female",0
" These encounters, which almost never amount to mortal combat, consist of head-butting, shoving, and perhaps attempts to overturn the other",0
 It is presumed that eventually one of the males exhausts himself and withdraws from the field while the other gains access to the female,0
"


== Preservation ==

Asian box turtles are in serious danger of extinction in their habitat because they are part of the food base of many Asian countries such as China, where they are captured for local food markets despite captive breeding farms",0
" North American box turtles, on the other hand, are endangered by habitat destruction",0
 The forests converted to farmland greatly reduced the number of turtles in many states,0
" The remaining land is often fragmented with highways and urban projects, destroying the animals' habitat",0
" In an attempt to cross man-made additions, turtles are often killed by cars, animals, and other hazards",0
 They are also facing population decline from a necrotizing bacterial infection first found in this species April 2011,0
Another serious treatment of these animals in North America is the capture and sale of hatchling box turtles from the wild,0
 A 3-year study conducted in Texas indicated that more than 7000 box turtles were taken from the wild for commercial trade,0
" A similar study in Louisiana found that over a 41-month period, about 30,000 box turtles were taken from the wild for resale",0
" Once captured, the turtles are often kept in poor conditions, in which more than half die",0
" Those that live long enough to be sold usually suffer from conditions such as malnutrition, dehydration, and infection",0
Indiana and many other states created strict laws against the collection of hatchling turtles from the wild,0
 In many states it is illegal to keep them without a special permit,0
" Collecting wild-hatched box turtles can cause irreversible damage to populations, because these turtles have a low reproductive rate, as they take a long time to find a mate",0
"
Most turtle and sea-turtle societies do not recommend the use of turtles as pets for young children despite their popularity as such",0
 Box turtles are easily stressed if touched excessively and require more care than is generally thought,0
 Box turtles can be easily injured by dogs and cats so special care must be taken to protect them from household pets and neighborhood animals,0
" Box turtles require an enclosed outdoor location, consistent sun exposure and a varied diet",0
" Without this, a turtle's growth can be stunted and its immune system weakened",0
"
Finding box turtles in the wild and taking them as pets, even for a short period, can have detrimental effects",0
 Box turtles want to stay within the area where they were hatched,0
" If one is moved more than half a mile from its territory, it may not find its way back, but may spend years searching for it",0
 This exposes the animal to danger and also disrupts the breeding cycle of which it would otherwise have been a part,0
"
While box turtles are very popular as pets, it is important that they are preserved in the right matter",0
 Keeping them in a more northern area where they can survive the best in ecological and physiological factor to not damage their way of living,0
"

"Ceramic art is art made from ceramic materials, including clay",1
" It may take forms including artistic pottery, including tableware, tiles, figurines and other sculpture",1
" As one of the plastic arts, ceramic art is one of the visual arts",1
"  While some ceramics are considered fine art, such as pottery or sculpture, most are considered to be decorative, industrial or applied art objects",1
  Ceramics may also be considered artefacts in archaeology,1
  Ceramic art can be made by one person or by a group of people,1
"  In a pottery or ceramic factory, a group of people design, manufacture and decorate the art ware",1
"  Products from a pottery are sometimes referred to as ""art pottery""",1
"  In a one-person pottery studio, ceramists or potters produce studio pottery",1
"
The word ""ceramics"" comes from the Greek keramikos (κεραμεικός), meaning ""pottery"", which in turn comes from keramos (κέραμος) meaning ""potter's clay""",1
"  Most traditional ceramic products were made from clay (or clay mixed with other materials), shaped and subjected to heat, and tableware and decorative ceramics are generally still made this way",1
" In modern ceramic engineering usage, ceramics is the art and science of making objects from inorganic, non-metallic materials by the action of heat",1
 It excludes glass and mosaic made from glass tesserae,1
"
There is a long history of ceramic art in almost all developed cultures, and often ceramic objects are all the artistic evidence left from vanished cultures, like that of the Nok in Africa over 2,000 years ago",1
"  Cultures especially noted for ceramics include the Chinese, Cretan, Greek, Persian, Mayan, Japanese, and Korean cultures, as well as the modern Western cultures",1
"
Elements of ceramic art, upon which different degrees of emphasis have been placed at different times, are the shape of the object, its decoration by painting, carving and other methods, and the glazing found on most ceramics",1
"


== Materials ==

Different types of clay, when used with different minerals and firing conditions, are used to produce earthenware, stoneware, porcelain and bone china (fine china)",1
"

Earthenware is pottery that has not been fired to vitrification and is thus permeable to water",1
" Many types of pottery have been made from it from the earliest times, and until the 18th century it was the most common type of pottery outside the far East",1
" Earthenware is often made from clay, quartz and feldspar",1
" Terracotta, a type of earthenware, is a clay-based unglazed or glazed ceramic, where the fired body is porous",1
"  Its uses include vessels (notably flower pots), water and waste water pipes, bricks, and surface embellishment in building construction",1
  Terracotta has been a common medium for ceramic art (see below),1
"
Stoneware is a vitreous or semi-vitreous ceramic made primarily from stoneware clay or non-refractory fire clay",1
  Stoneware is fired at high temperatures,1
" Vitrified or not, it is nonporous; it may or may not be glazed",1
"  One widely recognised definition is from the Combined Nomenclature of the European Communities, a European industry standard states ""Stoneware, which, though dense, impermeable and hard enough to resist scratching by a steel point, differs from porcelain because it is more opaque, and normally only partially vitrified",1
 It may be vitreous or semi-vitreous,1
" It is usually coloured grey or brownish because of impurities in the clay used for its manufacture, and is normally glazed",1
"""
Porcelain is a ceramic material made by heating materials, generally including kaolin, in a kiln to temperatures between 1,200 and 1,400 °C (2,200 and 2,600 °F)",1
" The toughness, strength and translucence of porcelain, relative to other types of pottery, arises mainly from vitrification and the formation of the mineral mullite within the body at these high temperatures",1
" Properties associated with porcelain include low permeability and elasticity; considerable strength, hardness, toughness, whiteness, translucency and resonance; and a high resistance to chemical attack and thermal shock",1
"  Porcelain has been described as being ""completely vitrified, hard, impermeable (even before glazing), white or artificially coloured, translucent (except when of considerable thickness), and resonant""",1
" However, the term porcelain lacks a universal definition and has ""been applied in a very unsystematic fashion to substances of diverse kinds which have only certain surface-qualities in common""",1
"
Bone china (fine china) is a type of soft-paste porcelain that is composed of bone ash, feldspathic material, and kaolin",1
 It has been defined as ware with a translucent body containing a minimum of 30% of phosphate derived from animal bone and calculated calcium phosphate,1
"  Developed by English potter Josiah Spode, bone china is known for its high levels of whiteness and translucency, and very high mechanical strength and chip resistance",1
 Its high strength allows it to be produced in thinner cross-sections than other types of porcelain,1
"  Like stoneware it is vitrified, but is translucent due to differing mineral properties",1
"  From its initial development and up to the later part of the twentieth century, bone china was almost exclusively an English product, with production being effectively localised in Stoke-on-Trent",1
" Most major English firms made or still make it, including Mintons, Coalport, Spode, Royal Crown Derby, Royal Doulton, Wedgwood and Worcester",1
"  In the UK, references to ""china"" or ""porcelain"" can refer to bone china, and ""English porcelain"" has been used as a term for it, both in the UK and around the world",1
"  Fine china is not necessarily bone china, and is a term used to refer to ware which does not contain bone ash",1
"


== Surface treatments ==


=== Painting ===

China painting, or porcelain painting is the decoration of glazed porcelain objects such as plates, bowls, vases or statues",1
" The body of the object may be hard-paste porcelain, developed in China in the 7th or 8th century, or soft-paste porcelain (often bone china), developed in 18th-century Europe",1
 The broader term ceramic painting includes painted decoration on lead-glazed earthenware such as creamware or tin-glazed pottery such as maiolica or faience,1
  Typically the body is first fired in a kiln to convert it into a hard porous biscuit,1
" Underglaze decoration may then be applied, followed by ceramic glaze, which is fired so it bonds to the body",1
 The glazed porcelain may then be decorated with overglaze painting and fired again at a lower temperature to bond the paint with the glaze,1
" Decoration may be applied by brush or by stenciling, transfer printing, lithography and screen printing",1
"


=== Slipware ===

Slipware is a type of pottery identified by its primary decorating process where slip is placed onto the leather-hard clay body surface before firing by dipping, painting or splashing",1
"  Slip is an aqueous suspension of a clay body, which is a mixture of clays and other minerals such as quartz, feldspar and mica",1
"  A coating of white or coloured slip, known as an engobe, can be applied to the article to improve its appearance, to give a smoother surface to a rough body, mask an inferior colour or for decorative effect",1
" Slips or engobes can also be applied by painting techniques, in isolation or in several layers and colours",1
 Sgraffito involves scratching through a layer of coloured slip to reveal a different colour or the base body underneath,1
 Several layers of slip and/or sgraffito can be done while the pot is still in an unfired state,1
"  One colour of slip can be fired, before a second is applied, and prior to the scratching or incising decoration",1
 This is particularly useful if the base body is not of the desired colour or texture,1
"


=== Terra sigillata ===

In sharp contrast to the archaeological usage, in which the term terra sigillata refers to a whole class of pottery, in contemporary ceramic art, 'terra sigillata' describes only a watery refined slip used to facilitate the burnishing of raw clay surfaces and used to promote carbon smoke effects, in both primitive low temperature firing techniques and unglazed alternative western-style Raku firing techniques",1
 Terra sigillata is also used as a brushable decorative colourant medium in higher temperature glazed ceramic techniques,1
"


== Forms ==


=== Studio pottery ===

Studio pottery is pottery made by amateur or professional artists or artisans working alone or in small groups, making unique items or short runs",1
" Typically, all stages of manufacture are carried out by the artists themselves",1
"  Studio pottery includes functional wares such as tableware, cookware and non-functional wares such as sculpture",1
"  Studio potters can be referred to as ceramic artists, ceramists, ceramicists or as an artist who uses clay as a medium",1
 Much studio pottery is tableware or cookware but an increasing number of studio potters produce non-functional or sculptural items,1
"  Some studio potters now prefer to call themselves ceramic artists, ceramists or simply artists",1
 Studio pottery is represented by potters all over the world,1
"


=== Tile ===

A tile is a manufactured piece of hard-wearing material such as ceramic, stone, metal, or even glass, generally used for covering roofs, floors, walls, showers, or other objects such as tabletops",1
" Alternatively, tile can sometimes refer to similar units made from lightweight materials such as perlite, wood, and mineral wool, typically used for wall and ceiling applications",1
" In another sense, a ""tile"" is a construction tile or similar object, such as rectangular counters used in playing games (see tile-based game)",1
" The word is derived from the French word tuile, which is, in turn, from the Latin word tegula, meaning a roof tile composed of fired clay",1
"
Tiles are often used to form wall murals and floor coverings, and can range from simple square tiles to complex mosaics",1
"  Tiles are most often made of ceramic, typically glazed for internal uses and unglazed for roofing, but other materials are also commonly used, such as glass, cork, concrete and other composite materials, and stone",1
" Tiling stone is typically marble, onyx, granite or slate",1
" Thinner tiles can be used on walls than on floors, which require more durable surfaces that will resist impacts",1
"


=== Figurines ===

A figurine (a diminutive form of the word figure) is a statuette that represents a human, deity, legendary creature, or animal",1
" Figurines may be realistic or iconic, depending on the skill and intention of the creator",1
 The earliest were made of stone or clay,1
"  In ancient Greece, many figurines were made from terracotta (see Greek terracotta figurines)",1
" Modern versions are made of ceramic, metal, glass, wood and plastic",1
"
Figurines and miniatures are sometimes used in board games, such as chess, and tabletop role playing games",1
" Old figurines have been used to discount some historical theories, such as the origins of chess",1
"


=== Tableware ===

Tableware is the dishes or dishware used for setting a table, serving food and dining",1
" It includes cutlery, glassware, serving dishes and other useful items for practical as well as decorative purposes",1
" Dishes, bowls and cups may be made of ceramic, while cutlery is typically made from metal, and glassware is often made from glass or other non-ceramic materials",1
"  The quality, nature, variety and number of objects varies according to culture, religion, number of diners, cuisine and occasion",1
" For example, Middle Eastern, Indian or Polynesian food culture and cuisine sometimes limits tableware to serving dishes, using bread or leaves as individual plates",1
 Special occasions are usually reflected in higher quality tableware,1
"


=== Terracotta (artworks) ===
In addition to being a material, ""terracotta"" also refers to items made out of this material",1
" In archaeology and art history, ""terracotta"" is often used to describe objects such as statues, and figurines not made on a potter's wheel",1
"  A prime example is the Terracotta Army, a collection of man-sized terracotta sculptures depicting the armies of Qin Shi Huang, the first Emperor of China",1
 It is a form of funerary art buried with the emperor in 210–209 BCE and whose purpose was to protect the emperor in his afterlife,1
"French sculptor Albert-Ernest Carrier-Belleuse made many terracotta pieces, but possibly the most famous is The Abduction of Hippodameia depicting the Greek mythological scene of a centaur kidnapping Hippodameia on her wedding day",1
" American architect Louis Sullivan is well known for his elaborate glazed terracotta ornamentation, designs that would have been impossible to execute in any other medium",1
" Terracotta and tile were used extensively in the town buildings of Victorian Birmingham, England",1
"


== History ==
There is a long history of ceramic art in almost all developed cultures, and often ceramic objects are all the artistic evidence left from vanished cultures, like that of the Nok in Africa over 3,000 years ago",1
" Cultures especially noted for ceramics include the Chinese, Cretan, Greek, Persian, Mayan, Japanese, and Korean cultures, as well as the modern Western cultures",1
" There is evidence that pottery was independently invented in several regions of the world, including East Asia, Sub-Saharan Africa, the Near East, and the Americas",1
"


=== Paleolithic pottery (c",1
" 20,000 BP) ===

Although pottery figurines are found from earlier periods in Europe, the oldest pottery vessels come from East Asia, with finds in China and Japan, then still linked by a land bridge, and some in what is now the Russian Far East, providing several from 20,000–10,000 BCE, although the vessels were simple utilitarian objects",1
" Xianrendong Cave in Jiangxi province contained pottery fragments that date back to 20,000 years ago",1
" These early pottery containers were made well before the invention of agriculture, by mobile foragers who hunted and gathered their food during the Late Glacial Maximum",1
" Many of the pottery fragments had scorch marks, suggesting that the pottery was used for cooking",1
"


=== Before Neolithic pottery: stone containers (12,000–6,000 BC) ===

Many remarkable containers were made from stone before the invention of pottery in Western Asia (which occurred around 7,000 BC), and before the invention of agriculture",1
" The Natufian culture created elegant stone mortars during the period between 12,000 and 9,500 BC",1
" Around 8000 BC, several early settlements became experts in crafting beautiful and highly sophisticated containers from stone, using materials such as alabaster or granite, and employing sand to shape and polish",1
 Artisans used the veins in the material to maximize visual effect,1
" Such object have been found in abundance on the upper Euphrates river, in what is today eastern Syria, especially at the site of Bouqras",1
 These form the early stages of the development of the Art of Mesopotamia,1
"

		
		
		


=== Neolithic pottery (6,500–3,500 BC) ===

Early pots were made by what is known as the ""coiling"" method, which worked the clay into a long string that wound to form a shape that later made smooth walls",1
"  The potter's wheel was probably invented in Mesopotamia by the 4th millennium BCE, but spread across nearly all Eurasia and much of Africa, though it remained unknown in the New World until the arrival of Europeans",1
"  Decoration of the clay by incising and painting is found very widely, and was initially geometric, but often included figurative designs from very early on",1
"
So important is pottery to the archaeology of prehistoric cultures that many are known by names taken from their distinctive, and often very fine, pottery, such as the Linear Pottery culture, Beaker culture, Globular Amphora culture, Corded Ware culture and Funnelbeaker culture, to take examples only from Neolithic Europe (approximately 7000–1800 BCE)",1
"
Ceramic art has generated many styles from its own tradition, but is often closely related to contemporary sculpture and metalwork",1
  Many times in its history styles from the usually more prestigious and expensive art of metalworking have been copied in ceramics,1
"  This can be seen in early Chinese ceramics, such as pottery and ceramic-wares of the Shang Dynasty, in Ancient Roman and Iranian pottery, and Rococo European styles, copying contemporary silverware shapes",1
"  A common use of ceramics is for ""pots"" - containers such as bowls, vases and amphorae, as well as other tableware, but figurines have been very widely made",1
"


=== Ceramics as wall decoration ===

The earliest evidence of glazed brick is the discovery of glazed bricks in the Elamite Temple at Chogha Zanbil, dated to the 13th century BCE",1
"  Glazed and coloured bricks were used to make low reliefs in Ancient Mesopotamia, most famously the Ishtar Gate of Babylon (c",1
" 575 BCE), now partly reconstructed in Berlin, with sections elsewhere",1
  Mesopotamian craftsmen were imported for the palaces of the Persian Empire such as Persepolis,1
"  The tradition continued, and after the Islamic conquest of Persia coloured and often painted glazed bricks or tiles became an important element in Persian architecture, and from there spread to much of the Islamic world, notably the İznik pottery of Turkey under the Ottoman Empire in the 16th and 17th centuries",1
"
Using the lusterware technology, one of the finest examples of medieval Islamic use of ceramics as wall decoration can be seen in the Mosque of Uqba also known as the Great Mosque of kairouan (in Tunisia), the upper part of the mihrab wall is adorned with polychrome and monochrome lusterware tiles; dating from 862 to 863, these tiles were most probably imported from Mesopotamia",1
"Transmitted via Islamic Iberia, a new tradition of Azulejos developed in Spain and especially Portugal, which by the Baroque period produced extremely large painted scenes on tiles, usually in blue and white",1
" Delftware tiles, typically with a painted design covering only one (rather small) tile, were ubiquitous in the Netherlands and widely exported over Northern Europe from the 16th century on",1
  Several 18th-century royal palaces had porcelain rooms with the walls entirely covered in porcelain,1
"  Surviving examples include ones at Capodimonte, Naples, the Royal Palace of Madrid and the nearby Royal Palace of Aranjuez",1
  Elaborate cocklestoves were a feature of rooms of the middle and upper-classes in Northern Europe from the 17th to 19th centuries,1
"
There are several other types of traditional tiles that remain in manufacture, for example, the small, almost mosaic, brightly coloured zellige tiles of Morocco",1
"  With exceptions, notably the Porcelain Tower of Nanjing, tiles or glazed bricks do not feature largely in East Asian ceramics",1
"


=== Regional developments ===
Although pottery figurines are found from earlier periods in Europe, the oldest pottery vessels come from East Asia, with finds in China and Japan, then still linked by a land bridge, and some in what is now the Russian Far East, providing several from between 20,000 and 10,000 BCE, although the vessels were simple utilitarian objects",1
" Xianrendong Cave in Jiangxi province contained pottery fragments that date back to 20,000 years ago",1
"


==== Cambodia ====
Recent archaeological excavations at Angkor Borei (in southern Cambodia) have recovered a large number of ceramics, some of which probably date back to the prehistoric period",1
" Most of the pottery, however, dates to the pre-Angkorian period and consists mainly of pinkish terracotta pots which were either hand-made or thrown on a wheel, and then decorated with incised patterns",1
"
Glazed wares first appear in the archaeological record at the end of the 9th century at the Roluos temple group in the Angkor region, where green-glazed pot shards have been found",1
 A brown glaze became popular at the beginning of the 11th century and brown-glazed wares have been found in abundance at Khmer sites in northeast Thailand,1
 Decorating pottery with animal forms was a popular style from the 11th to 13th century,1
 Archaeological excavations in the Angkor region have revealed that towards the end of Angkor period production of indigenous pottery declined while there was a dramatic increase in Chinese ceramic imports,1
"
Direct evidence of the shapes of vessels is provided by scenes depicted on bas-reliefs at Khmer temples, which also offer insight into domestic and ritualistic uses of the wares",1
" The wide range of utilitarian shapes suggest the Khmers used ceramics in their daily life for cooking, food preservation, carrying and storing liquids, as containers for medicinal herbs, perfumes and cosmetics",1
"


==== China ====

There is Chinese porcelain from the late Eastern Han period (100–200 CE), the Three Kingdoms period (220–280 CE), the Six Dynasties period (220–589 CE), and thereafter",1
"  China in particular has had a continuous history of large-scale production, with the Imperial factories usually producing the best work",1
"  The Tang Dynasty (618 to 906 CE) is especially noted for grave goods figures of humans, animals and model houses, boats and other goods, excavated (usually illegally) from graves in large numbers",1
"
Some experts believe the first true porcelain was made in the province of Zhejiang in China during the Eastern Han period",1
" Shards recovered from archaeological Eastern Han kiln sites estimated firing temperature ranged from 1,260 to 1,300 °C (2,300 to 2,370 °F)",1
" As far back as 1000 BCE, the so-called ""porcelaneous wares"" or ""proto-porcelain wares"" were made using at least some kaolin fired at high temperatures",1
 The dividing line between the two and true porcelain wares is not a clear one,1
 Archaeological finds have pushed the dates to as early as the Han Dynasty (206–BCE – 220 CE),1
"The Imperial porcelain of the Song Dynasty (960–1279), featuring very subtle decoration shallowly carved by knife in the clay, is regarded by many authorities as the peak of Chinese ceramics, though the large and more exuberantly painted ceramics of the Ming Dynasty (1368–1644) have a wider reputation",1
"
Chinese emperors gave ceramics as diplomatic gifts on a lavish scale, and the presence of Chinese ceramics no doubt aided the development of related traditions of ceramics in Japan and Korea in particular",1
"
Until the 16th century, small quantities of expensive Chinese porcelain were imported into Europe",1
"  From the 16th century onwards attempts were made to imitate it in Europe, including soft-paste and the Medici porcelain made in Florence",1
 None was successful until a recipe for hard-paste porcelain was devised at the Meissen factory in Dresden in 1710,1
" Within a few years, porcelain factories sprung up at Nymphenburg in Bavaria (1754) and Capodimonte in Naples (1743) and many other places, often financed by a local ruler",1
"


==== Japan ====

The earliest Japanese pottery was made around the 11th millennium BCE",1
 Jōmon ware emerged in the 6th millennium BCE and the plainer Yayoi style in about the 4th century BCE,1
"  This early pottery was soft earthenware, fired at low temperatures",1
" The potter's wheel and a kiln capable of reaching higher temperatures and firing stoneware appeared in the 3rd or 4th centuries CE, probably brought from China via the Korean peninsula",1
" In the 8th century, official kilns in Japan produced simple, green lead-glazed earthenware",1
"  Unglazed stoneware was used as funerary jars, storage jars and kitchen pots up to the 17th century",1
"  Some of the kilns improved their methodsmil From the 11th to the 16th century, Japan imported much porcelain from China and some from Korea",1
" The Japanese overlord Toyotomi Hideyoshi's attempts to conquer China in the 1590s were dubbed the ""Ceramic Wars""; the emigration of Korean potters appeared to be a major cause",1
" One of these potters, Yi Sam-pyeong, discovered the raw material of porcelain in Arita and produced first true porcelain in Japan",1
"
In the 17th century, conditions in China drove some of its potters into Japan, bringing with them the knowledge to make refined porcelain",1
" From the mid-century, the Dutch East India Company began to import Japanese porcelain into Europe",1
"  At this time, Kakiemon wares were produced at the factories of Arita, which had much in common with the Chinese Famille Verte style",1
 The superb quality of its enamel decoration was highly prized in the West and widely imitated by the major European porcelain manufacturers,1
"  In 1971 it was declared an important ""intangible cultural treasure"" by the Japanese government",1
"
In the 20th century, interest in the art of the village potter was revived by the Mingei folk movement led by potters Shoji Hamada, Kawai Kajiro and others",1
 They studied traditional methods in order to preserve native wares that were in danger of disappearing,1
" Modern masters use ancient methods to bring pottery and porcelain to new heights of achievement at Shiga, Iga, Karatsu, Hagi, and Bizen",1
 A few outstanding potters were designated living cultural treasures (mukei bunkazai 無形文化財),1
" In the old capital of Kyoto, the Raku family continued to produce the rough tea bowls that had so delighted connoisseurs",1
" At Mino, potters continued to reconstruct the classic formulas of Momoyama-era Seto-type tea wares of Mino, such as Oribe ware",1
 By the 1990s many master potters worked away from ancient kilns and made classic wares in all parts of Japan,1
"


==== Korea ====

Korean pottery has had a continuous tradition since simple earthenware from about 8000 BCE",1
" Styles have generally been a distinctive variant of Chinese, and later Japanese, developments",1
  The ceramics of the Goryeo Dynasty (918–1392) and early Joseon white porcelain of the following dynasty are generally regarded as the finest achievements,1
"


=== Western Asia and the Middle East ===


==== Islamic pottery ====

From the 8th to 18th centuries, glazed ceramics was important in Islamic art, usually in the form of elaborate pottery, developing on vigorous Persian and Egyptian pre-Islamic traditions in particular",1
" Tin-opacified glazing was developed by the Islamic potters, the first examples found as blue-painted ware in Basra, dating from about the 8th century",1
"  The Islamic world had contact with China, and increasingly adapted many Chinese decorative motifs",1
"  Persian wares gradually relaxed Islamic restrictions on figurative ornament, and painted figuratives scenes became very important",1
"

Stoneware was also an important craft in Islamic pottery, produced throughout Iraq and Syria by the 9th century",1
" Pottery was produced in Raqqa, Syria, in the 8th century",1
" Other centers for innovative ceramics in the Islamic world were Fustat (near modern Cairo) from 975 to 1075, Damascus from 1100 to around 1600 and Tabriz from 1470 to 1550",1
"The albarello form, a type of maiolica earthenware jar originally designed to hold apothecaries' ointments and dry drugs, was first made in the Islamic Middle East",1
 It was brought to Italy by Hispano-Moresque traders; the earliest Italian examples were produced in Florence in the 15th century,1
"
Iznik pottery, made in western Anatolia, is highly decorated ceramics whose heyday was the late 16th century under the Ottoman sultans",1
"  Iznik vessels were originally made in imitation of Chinese porcelain, which was highly prized",1
" Under Süleyman the Magnificent (1520–66), demand for Iznik wares increased",1
"  After the conquest of Constantinople in 1453, the Ottoman sultans started a programme of building, which used large quantities of Iznik tiles",1
" The Sultan Ahmed Mosque in Istanbul (built 1609–16) alone contains 20,000 tiles and tiles were used extensively in the Topkapi Palace (commenced 1459)",1
"  As a result of this demand, tiles dominated the output of the Iznik potteries",1
"


=== Europe ===


==== Early figurines ====
The earliest known ceramic objects are the Gravettian figurines from the Upper Paleolithic period, such as those discovered at Dolní Věstonice in the modern-day Czech Republic",1
" The Venus of Dolní Věstonice (Věstonická Venuše in Czech) is a statuette of a nude female figure dating from some time from 29,000–25,000 BCE",1
  It was made by moulding and then firing a mixture of clay and powdered bone,1
 Similar objects in various media found throughout Europe and Asia and dating from the Upper Paleolithic period have also been called Venus figurines,1
 Scholars are not agreed as to their purpose or cultural significance,1
"


==== The ancient Mediterranean ====

Glazed Egyptian faience dates to the third millennium BCE), with painted but unglazed pottery used even earlier during the predynastic Naqada culture",1
" Faience became sophisticated and produced on a large scale, using moulds as well modelling, and later also throwing on the wheel",1
" Several methods of glazing were developed, but colours remained largely limited to a range in the blue-green spectrum",1
"
On the Greek island of Santorini are some of the earliest finds created by the Minoans dating to the third millennium BCE, with the original settlement at Akrotiri dating to the fourth millennium BCE;  excavation work continues at the principal archaeological site of Akrotiri",1
  Some of the excavated homes contain huge ceramic storage jars known as pithoi,1
"
Ancient Greek and Etruscan ceramics are renowned for their figurative painting, especially in the black-figure and red-figure styles",1
"  Moulded Greek terracotta figurines, especially those from Tanagra, were small figures, often religious but later including many of everyday genre figures, apparently used purely for decoration",1
"
Ancient Roman pottery, such as Samian ware, was rarely as fine, and largely copied shapes from metalwork, but was produced in enormous quantities, and is found all over Europe and the Middle East, and beyond",1
 Monte Testaccio is a waste mound in Rome made almost entirely of broken amphorae used for transporting and storing liquids and other products,1
"  Few vessels of great artistic interest have survived, but there are very many small figures, often incorporated into oil lamps or similar objects, and often with religious or erotic themes (or both together – a Roman speciality)",1
"  The Romans generally did not leave grave goods, the best source of ancient pottery, but even so they do not seem to have had much in the way of luxury pottery, unlike Roman glass, which the elite used with gold or silver tableware",1
"  The more expensive pottery tended to use relief decoration, often moulded, rather than paint",1
"  Especially in the Eastern Empire, local traditions continued, hybridizing with Roman styles to varying extents",1
"


==== Tin-glazed pottery ====

Tin-glazed pottery, or faience, originated in Iraq in the 9th century, from where it spread to Egypt, Persia and Spain before reaching Italy in the Renaissance, Holland in the 16th century and England, France and other European countries shortly after",1
"  Important regional styles in Europe include: Hispano-Moresque, maiolica, Delftware, and English Delftware",1
" By the High Middle Ages the Hispano-Moresque ware of Al-Andaluz was the most sophisticated pottery being produced in Europe, with elaborate decoration",1
" It introduced tin-glazing to Europe, which was developed in the Italian Renaissance in maiolica",1
" Tin-glazed pottery was taken up in the Netherlands from the 16th to the 18th centuries, the potters making household, decorative pieces and tiles in vast numbers, usually with blue painting on a white ground",1
"  Dutch potters took tin-glazed pottery to the British Isles, where it was made between about 1550 and 1800",1
" In France, tin-glaze was begun in 1690 at Quimper in Brittany, followed in Rouen, Strasbourg and Lunéville",1
" The development of white, or near white, firing bodies in Europe from the late 18th century, such as Creamware by Josiah Wedgwood and porcelain, reduced the demand for Delftware, faience and majolica",1
" Today, tin oxide usage in glazes finds limited use in conjunction with other, lower cost opacifying agents, although it is generally restricted to specialist low temperature applications and use by studio potters, including Picasso who produced pottery using tin glazes",1
"


==== Porcelain ====

Until the 16th century, small quantities of expensive Chinese porcelain were imported into Europe",1
"  From the 16th century onwards attempts were made to imitate it in Europe, including soft-paste and the Medici porcelain made in Florence",1
" In 1712, many of the elaborate Chinese porcelain manufacturing secrets were revealed throughout Europe by the French Jesuit father Francois Xavier d'Entrecolles and soon published in the Lettres édifiantes et curieuses de Chine par des missionnaires jésuites  After much experimentation, a recipe for hard-paste porcelain was devised at the Meissen porcelain factory in Dresden soon after 1710, and was on sale by 1713",1
" Within a few decades, porcelain factories sprung up at Nymphenburg in Bavaria (1754) and Capodimonte in Naples (1743) and many other places, often financed by a local ruler",1
"
Soft-paste porcelain was made at Rouen in the 1680s, but the first important production was at St",1
"Cloud, letters-patent being granted in 1702",1
"  The Duc de Bourbon established a soft-paste factory, the Chantilly porcelain, in the grounds of his Château de Chantilly in 1730; a soft-paste factory was opened at Mennecy; and the Vincennes factory was set up by workers from Chantilly in 1740, moving to larger premises at Sèvres in 1756",1
  The superior soft-paste made at Sèvres put it in the leading position in Europe in the second half of the 18th century,1
"  The first soft-paste in England was demonstrated in 1742, apparently based on the Saint-Cloud formula",1
"  In 1749 a patent was taken out on the first bone china, subsequently perfected by Josiah Spode",1
"  The main English porcelain makers in the 18th century were at Chelsea, Bow,  St James's, Bristol, Derby  and Lowestoft",1
"
Porcelain was ideally suited to the energetic Rococo curves of the day",1
"  The products of these early decades of European porcelain are generally the most highly regarded, and expensive",1
  The Meissen modeler Johann Joachim Kaendler and Franz Anton Bustelli of Nymphenburg are perhaps the most outstanding ceramic artists of the period,1
"  Like other leading modelers, they trained as sculptors and produced models from which moulds were taken",1
"
By the end of the 18th century owning porcelain tableware and decorative objects had become obligatory among the prosperous middle-classes of Europe, and there were factories in most countries, many of which are still producing",1
"  As well as tableware, early European porcelain revived the taste for purely decorative figures of people or animals, which had also been a feature of several ancient cultures, often as grave goods",1
"  These were still being produced in China as blanc de Chine religious figures, many of which had reached Europe",1
"  European figures were almost entirely secular, and soon brightly and brilliantly painted, often in groups with a modelled setting, and a strong narrative element (see picture)",1
"


==== Wedgwood and the North Staffordshire Potteries ====

From the 17th century, Stoke-on-Trent in North Staffordshire emerged as a major centre of pottery making",1
"  Important contributions to the development of the industry were made by the firms of Wedgwood, Spode, Royal Doulton and Minton",1
"
The local presence of abundant supplies of coal and suitable clay for earthenware production led to the early but at first limited development of the local pottery industry",1
 The construction of the Trent and Mersey Canal allowed the easy transportation of china clay from Cornwall together with other materials and facilitated the production of creamware and bone china,1
"  Other production centres had a lead in the production of high quality wares but the preeminence of North Staffordshire was brought about by methodical and detailed research and a willingness to experiment carried out over many years, initially by one man, Josiah Wedgwood",1
"  His lead was followed by other local potters, scientists and engineers",1
"
Wedgwood is credited with the industrialization of the manufacture of pottery",1
"  His work was of very high quality: when visiting his workshop, if he saw an offending vessel that failed to meet with his standards, he would smash it with his stick, exclaiming, ""This will not do for Josiah Wedgwood!"" He was keenly interested in the scientific advances of his day and it was this interest that underpinned his adoption of its approach and methods to revolutionize the quality of his pottery",1
 His unique glazes began to distinguish his wares from anything else on the market,1
"  His matt finish jasperware in two colours was highly suitable for the Neoclassicism of the end of the century, imitating the effects of Ancient Roman carved gemstone cameos like the Gemma Augustea, or the cameo glass Portland Vase, of which Wedgwood produced copies",1
"
He also is credited with perfecting transfer-printing, first developed in England about 1750",1
" By the end of the century this had largely replaced hand-painting for complex designs, except at the luxury end of the market, and the vast majority of the world's decorated pottery uses versions of the technique to the present day",1
 The perfecting of underglaze transfer printing is widely credited to Josiah Spode the first,1
" The process had been used as a development from the processes used in book printing, and early paper quality made a very refined detail in the design incapable of reproduction, so early print patterns were rather lacking in subtlety of tonal variation",1
" The development of machine made thinner printing papers around 1804 allowed the engravers to use a much wider variety of tonal techniques which became capable of being reproduced on the ware, much more successfully",1
"
Far from perfecting underglaze print Wedgwood was persuaded by his painters not to adopt underglaze printing until it became evident that Mr Spode was taking away his business through competitive pricing for a much more heavily decorated high quality product",1
"
Stoke-on-Trent's supremacy in pottery manufacture nurtured and attracted a large number of ceramic artists including Clarice Cliff, Susie Cooper, Lorna Bailey, Charlotte Rhead, Frederick Hurten Rhead and Jabez Vodrey",1
"


==== Studio pottery in Britain ====
Studio pottery is made by artists working alone or in small groups, producing unique items or short runs, typically with all stages of manufacture carried out by one individual",1
" It is represented by potters all over the world but has strong roots in Britain, with potters such as Bernard Leach, William Staite Murray, Dora Billington, Lucie Rie and Hans Coper",1
 Bernard Leach (1887–1979) established a style of pottery influenced by Far-Eastern and medieval English forms,1
" After briefly experimenting with earthenware, he turned to stoneware fired to high temperatures in large oil- or wood-burning kilns",1
  This style dominated British studio pottery in the mid-20th-century,1
  The Austrian refugee Lucie Rie (1902–1995) has been regarded as essentially a modernist who experimented with new glaze effects on often brightly coloured bowls and bottles,1
" Hans Coper (1920–1981) produced non-functional, sculptural and unglazed pieces",1
"  After the Second World War, studio pottery in Britain was encouraged by the wartime ban on decorating manufactured pottery and the modernist spirit of the Festival of Britain",1
"  The simple, functional designs chimed in with the modernist ethos",1
"  Several potteries were formed in response to this fifties boom, and this style of studio pottery remained popular into the nineteen-seventies",1
 Elizabeth Fritsch (1940-) took up ceramics working under Hans Coper at the Royal College of Art (1968–1971),1
 Fritsch was one of a group of outstanding ceramicists who emerged from the Royal College of Art at that time,1
 Fritschs' ceramic vessels broke away from traditional methods and she developed a hand built flattened coil technique in stoneware smoothed and refined into accurately profiled forms,1
" They are then hand painted with dry matt slips, in colours unusual for ceramics",1
"


==== Pottery in Germany ====
German pottery has its roots in the alchemistry laboratories searching for gold production",1
"

Royal Porcelain Factory, Berlin 
Meissen porcelain
Nymphenburg porcelain
Hutschenreuther


==== Pottery in Austria ====
In 1718 a pottery was founded in Vienna",1
"


==== Pottery in Russia ====
The Imperial Porcelain Manufacture was founded in 1744 in Oranienbaum, Russia",1
 It was based on the invention of porcelain by D,1
 I,1
" Winogradow (independent from Böttgers invention 1708, Dresden)",1
 An important collection of antique porcelain is preserved in the Russian Museum of Ceramics,1
"


=== The Americas ===


==== Native American pottery ====

The people in North, Central, and South America continents had a wide variety of pottery traditions before Europeans arrived",1
" The oldest ceramics known in the Americas‍—‌made from 5,000 to 6,000 years ago‍—‌are found in the Andean region, along the Pacific coast of Ecuador  at Valdivia and Puerto Hormiga, and in the San Jacinto Valley of Colombia; objects from 3,800 to 4,000 years old have been discovered in Peru",1
" Some archaeologists believe that ceramics know-how found its way by sea to Mesoamerica, the second great cradle of civilization in the Americas",1
The best-developed styles found in the central and southern Andes are the ceramics found near the ceremonial site at Chavín de Huántar (800–400 BCE) and Cupisnique (1000–400 BCE),1
"  During the same period, another culture developed on the southern coast of Peru, in the area called Paracas",1
 The Paracas culture (600–100 BCE) produced marvelous works of embossed ceramic finished with a thick oil applied after firing,1
" This colorful tradition in ceramics and textiles was followed by the Nazca culture (1–600 CE), whose potters developed improved techniques for preparing clay and for decorating objects, using fine brushes to paint sophisticated motifs",1
" In the early stage of Nazca ceramics, potters painted realistic characters and landscapes",1
"
The Moche cultures (1–800 CE) that flourished on the northern coast of modern Peru produced modelled clay sculptures and effigies decorated with fine lines of red on a beige background",1
"  Their pottery stands out for its huacos portrait vases, in which human faces are shown expressing different emotions‍—‌happiness, sadness, anger, melancholy‍—‌as well for its complicated drawings of wars, human sacrifices, and celebrations",1
"The Maya were relative latecomers to ceramic development, as their ceramic arts flourished in the Maya Classic Period, or the 2nd to 10th century",1
"  One important site in southern Belize is known as Lubaantun, that boasts particularly detailed and prolific works",1
"  As evidence of the extent to which these ceramic art works were prized, many specimens traced to Lubaantun have been found at distant Maya sites in Honduras and Guatemala",1
"  Furthermore, the current Maya people of Lubaantun continue to hand produce copies of many of the original designs found at Lubaantun",1
"
In the United States, the oldest pottery dates to 2500 BCE",1
"  It has been found in the Timucuan Ecological and Historic Preserve in Jacksonville, Florida, and some slightly older along the Savannah River in Georgia",1
"The Hopi in Northern Arizona and several other Puebloan peoples including the Taos, Acoma, and Zuñi people (all in the Southwestern United States) are renowned for painted pottery in several different styles",1
 Nampeyo and her relatives created pottery that became highly sought after beginning in the early 20th century,1
  Pueblo tribes in the state of New Mexico have styles distinctive to each of the various pueblos (villages),1
" They include Santa Clara Pueblo, Taos Pueblo, Hopi Pueblos, San Ildefonso Pueblo, Acoma Pueblo and Zuni Pueblo, amongst others",1
" Some of the renowned artists of Pueblo pottery include: Nampeyo, Elva Nampeyo, and Dextra Quotskuyva of the Hopi; Leonidas Tapia of San Juan Pueblo; and Maria Martinez and Julian Martinez of San Ildefonso Pueblo",1
 In the early 20th century Martinez and her husband Julian rediscovered the method of creating traditional San Ildefonso Pueblo Black-on Black pottery,1
"


==== Mexican ceramics ====

Mexican ceramics are an ancient tradition",1
" Precolumbian potters built up their wares with pinching, coiling, or hammer-an-anvil methods and, instead of using glaze, burnished their pots",1
"


==== Studio pottery in the United States ====

There is a strong tradition of studio artists working in ceramics in the United States",1
 It had a period of growth in the 1960s and continues to present times,1
" Many fine art, craft, and contemporary art museums have pieces in their permanent collections",1
" Beatrice Wood was an American artist and studio potter located in Ojai, California",1
" She developed a unique form of luster-glaze technique, and was active from the 1930s to her death in 1998 at 105 years old",1
" Robert Arneson created larger sculptural work, in an abstracted representational style",1
" There are ceramics arts departments at many colleges, universities, and fine arts institutes in the United States",1
"


=== Sub-Saharan Africa ===
It appears that pottery was independently developed in Sub-Saharan Africa during the 10th millennium BC, with findings dating to at least 9,400 BC from central Mali",1
" In Africa, the earliest pottery has been found in the large mountain massifs of the Central Sahara, in the Eastern Sahara, and the Nile Valley, dating back to between the ninth and tenth millennium",1
Pottery in Sub-Saharan Africa is traditionally made by coiling and is fired at low temperature,1
"  The figurines of the ancient Nok culture, whose function remains unclear, are an example of high-quality figural work, found in many cultures, such as the Benin of Nigeria",1
"
In the Aïr Region of Niger (West Africa) (Haour 2003) pottery dating from around 10,000 BCE was excavated",1
"Ladi Kwali, a Nigerian potter who worked in the Gwari tradition, made large pots decorated with incised patterns",1
 Her work is an interesting hybrid of traditional African with western studio pottery,1
 Magdalene Odundo is a Kenyan-born British studio potter whose ceramics are hand built and burnished,1
"


== Ceramics museums and museum collections ==

A ceramics museum is a museum wholly or largely devoted to ceramics, normally ceramic artworks, whose collections may include glass and enamel as well, but will usually concentrate on pottery, including porcelain",1
" Most national ceramics collections are in a more general museum covering all the arts, or just the decorative arts, but there are a number of specialized ceramics museums, some concentrating on the production of just one country, region or manufacturer",1
"  Others have international collections, which may concentrate on ceramics from Europe or East Asia, or have global coverage",1
"
In Asian and Islamic countries ceramics are usually a strong feature of general and national museums",1
"  Also most specialist archaeological museums, in all countries, have large ceramics collections, as pottery is the commonest type of archaeological artifact",1
  Most of these are broken shards however,1
"
Outstanding major ceramics collections in general museums include The Palace Museum, Beijing, with 340,000 pieces, and the National Palace Museum in Taipei city, Taiwan (25,000 pieces); both are mostly derived from the Chinese Imperial collection, and are almost entirely of pieces from China",1
"  In London, the Victoria and Albert Museum (over 75,000 pieces, mostly after 1400 CE) and British Museum (mostly before 1400 CE) have very strong international collections",1
"  The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York and Freer Gallery of Art in Washington DC (thousands, all Asian) have perhaps the best of the many fine collections in the large city museums of the United States",1
" The Corning Museum of Glass, in Corning, New York, has more than 45,000 glass objects",1
"

UK Ceramics Information – British Ceramic BrandsConceptual art, also referred to as conceptualism, is art in which the concept(s) or idea(s) involved in the work take precedence over traditional aesthetic, technical, and material concerns",1
" Some works of conceptual art, sometimes called installations, may be constructed by anyone simply by following a set of written instructions",1
" This method was fundamental to American artist Sol LeWitt's definition of conceptual art, one of the first to appear in print:

In conceptual art the idea or concept is the most important aspect of the work",1
" When an artist uses a conceptual form of art, it means that all of the planning and decisions are made beforehand and the execution is a perfunctory affair",1
 The idea becomes a machine that makes the art,1
"
Tony Godfrey, author of Conceptual Art (Art & Ideas) (1998), asserts that conceptual art questions the nature of art, a notion that Joseph Kosuth elevated to a definition of art itself in his seminal, early manifesto of conceptual art, Art after Philosophy (1969)",1
 The notion that art should examine its own nature was already a potent aspect of the influential art critic Clement Greenberg's vision of Modern art during the 1950s,1
" With the emergence of an exclusively language-based art in the 1960s, however, conceptual artists such as Art & Language, Joseph Kosuth (who became the American editor of Art-Language), and Lawrence Weiner began a far more radical interrogation of art than was previously possible (see below)",1
 One of the first and most important things they questioned was the common assumption that the role of the artist was to create special kinds of material objects,1
"Through its association with the Young British Artists and the Turner Prize during the 1990s, in popular usage, particularly in the United Kingdom, ""conceptual art"" came to denote all contemporary art that does not practice the traditional skills of painting and sculpture",1
" One of the reasons why the term ""conceptual art"" has come to be associated with various contemporary practices far removed from its original aims and forms lies in the problem of defining the term itself",1
" As the artist Mel Bochner suggested as early as 1970, in explaining why he does not like the epithet ""conceptual"", it is not always entirely clear what ""concept"" refers to, and it runs the risk of being confused with ""intention""",1
" Thus, in describing or defining a work of art as conceptual it is important not to confuse what is referred to as ""conceptual"" with an artist's ""intention""",1
"


== Precursors ==

The French artist Marcel Duchamp paved the way for the conceptualists, providing them with examples of prototypically conceptual works — the readymades, for instance",1
" The most famous of Duchamp's readymades was Fountain (1917), a standard urinal-basin signed by the artist with the pseudonym ""R",1
"Mutt"", and submitted for inclusion in the annual, un-juried exhibition of the Society of Independent Artists in New York (which rejected it)",1
" The artistic tradition does not see a commonplace object (such as a urinal) as art because it is not made by an artist or with any intention of being art, nor is it unique or hand-crafted",1
" Duchamp's relevance and theoretical importance for future ""conceptualists"" was later acknowledged by US artist Joseph Kosuth in his 1969 essay, Art after Philosophy, when he wrote: ""All art (after Duchamp) is conceptual (in nature) because art only exists conceptually""",1
"
In 1956 the founder of Lettrism, Isidore Isou, developed the notion of a work of art which, by its very nature, could never be created in reality, but which could nevertheless provide aesthetic rewards by being contemplated intellectually",1
" This concept, also called Art esthapériste (or ""infinite-aesthetics""), derived from the infinitesimals of Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz – quantities which could not actually exist except conceptually",1
" The current incarnation (As of 2013) of the Isouian movement, Excoördism, self-defines as the art of the infinitely large and the infinitely small",1
"


== Origins ==
In 1961, philosopher and artist Henry Flynt coined the term ""concept art"" in an article bearing the same name which appeared in the proto-Fluxus publication An Anthology of Chance Operations",1
" Flynt's concept art, he maintained, devolved from his notion of ""cognitive nihilism"", in which paradoxes in logic are shown to evacuate concepts of substance",1
" Drawing on the syntax of logic and mathematics, concept art was meant jointly to supersede mathematics and the formalistic music then current in serious art music circles",1
" Therefore, Flynt maintained, to merit the label concept art, a work had to be a critique of logic or mathematics in which a linguistic concept was the material, a quality which is absent from subsequent ""conceptual art""",1
"The term assumed a different meaning when employed by Joseph Kosuth and by the English Art and Language group, who discarded the conventional art object in favour of a documented critical inquiry, that began in Art-Language: The Journal of Conceptual Art in 1969, into the artist's social, philosophical, and psychological status",1
" By the mid-1970s they had produced publications, indices, performances, texts and paintings to this end",1
" In 1970 Conceptual Art and Conceptual Aspects, the first dedicated conceptual-art exhibition, took place at the New York Cultural Center",1
"


== The critique of formalism and of the commodification of art ==
Conceptual art emerged as a movement during the 1960s – in part as a reaction against formalism as then articulated by the influential New York art critic Clement Greenberg",1
" According to Greenberg Modern art followed a process of progressive reduction and refinement toward the goal of defining the essential, formal nature of each medium",1
 Those elements that ran counter to this nature were to be reduced,1
" The task of painting, for example, was to define precisely what kind of object a painting truly is: what makes it a painting and nothing else",1
" As it is of the nature of paintings to be flat objects with canvas surfaces onto which colored pigment is applied, such things as figuration, 3-D perspective illusion and references to external subject matter were all found to be extraneous to the essence of painting, and ought to be removed",1
"Some have argued that conceptual art continued this ""dematerialization"" of art by removing the need for objects altogether,
while others, including many of the artists themselves, saw conceptual art as a radical break with Greenberg's kind of formalist Modernism",1
" Later artists continued to share a preference for art to be self-critical, as well as a distaste for illusion",1
" However, by the end of the 1960s it was certainly clear that Greenberg's stipulations for art to continue within the confines of each medium and to exclude external subject matter no longer held traction",1
"
Conceptual art also reacted against the commodification of art; it attempted a subversion of the gallery or museum as the location and determiner of art, and the art market as the owner and distributor of art",1
" Lawrence Weiner said: ""Once you know about a work of mine you own it",1
 There's no way I can climb inside somebody's head and remove it,1
""" Many conceptual artists' work can therefore only be known about through documentation which is manifested by it, e",1
g,1
", photographs, written texts or displayed objects, which some might argue are not in and of themselves the art",1
" It is sometimes (as in the work of Robert Barry, Yoko Ono, and Weiner himself) reduced to a set of written instructions describing a work, but stopping short of actually making it—emphasising the idea as more important than the artifact",1
" This reveals an explicit preference for the ""art"" side of the ostensible dichotomy between art and craft, where art, unlike craft, takes place within and engages historical discourse: for example, Ono's ""written instructions"" make more sense alongside other conceptual art of the time",1
"


== Language and/as art ==
Language was a central concern for the first wave of conceptual artists of the 1960s and early 1970s",1
" Although the utilisation of text in art was in no way novel, only in the 1960s did the artists Lawrence Weiner, Edward Ruscha, Joseph Kosuth, Robert Barry, and Art & Language begin to produce art by exclusively linguistic means",1
" Where previously language was presented as one kind of visual element alongside others, and subordinate to an overarching composition (e",1
g,1
" Synthetic Cubism), the conceptual artists used language in place of brush and canvas, and allowed it to signify in its own right",1
" Of Lawrence Weiner's works Anne Rorimer writes, ""The thematic content of individual works derives solely from the import of the language employed, while presentational means and contextual placement play crucial, yet separate, roles",1
"""The British philosopher and theorist of conceptual art Peter Osborne suggests that among the many factors that influenced the gravitation toward language-based art, a central role for conceptualism came from the turn to linguistic theories of meaning in both Anglo-American analytic philosophy, and structuralist and post structuralist Continental philosophy during the middle of the twentieth century",1
" This linguistic turn ""reinforced and legitimized"" the direction the conceptual artists took",1
 Osborne also notes that the early conceptualists were the first generation of artists to complete degree-based university training in art,1
" Osborne later made the observation that contemporary art is post-conceptual in a public lecture delivered at the Fondazione Antonio Ratti, Villa Sucota in Como on July 9, 2010",1
 It is a claim made at the level of the ontology of the work of art (rather than say at the descriptive level of style or movement),1
"
The American art historian Edward A",1
" Shanken points to the example of Roy Ascott who ""powerfully demonstrates the significant intersections between conceptual art and art-and-technology, exploding the conventional autonomy of these art-historical categories",1
""" Ascott, the British artist most closely associated with cybernetic art in England, was not included in Cybernetic Serendipity because his use of cybernetics was primarily conceptual and did not explicitly utilize technology",1
" Conversely, although his essay on the application of cybernetics to art and art pedagogy, ""The Construction of Change"" (1964), was quoted on the dedication page (to Sol LeWitt) of Lucy R",1
" Lippard's seminal Six Years: The Dematerialization of the Art Object from 1966 to 1972, Ascott's anticipation of and contribution to the formation of conceptual art in Britain has received scant recognition, perhaps (and ironically) because his work was too closely allied with art-and-technology",1
" Another vital intersection was explored in Ascott's use of the thesaurus in 1963 telematic connections:: timeline, which drew an explicit parallel between the taxonomic qualities of verbal and visual languages – a concept that would be taken up in Joseph Kosuth's Second Investigation, Proposition 1 (1968) and Mel Ramsden's Elements of an Incomplete Map (1968)",1
"


== Conceptual art and artistic skill ==

By adopting language as their exclusive medium, Weiner, Barry, Wilson, Kosuth and Art & Language were able to sweep aside the vestiges of authorial presence manifested by formal invention and the handling of materials",1
"

An important difference between conceptual art and more ""traditional"" forms of art-making goes to the question of artistic skill",1
" Although skill in the handling of traditional media often plays little role in conceptual art, it is difficult to argue that no skill is required to make conceptual works, or that skill is always absent from them",1
" John Baldessari, for instance, has presented realist pictures that he commissioned professional sign-writers to paint; and many conceptual performance artists (e",1
g,1
" Stelarc, Marina Abramović) are technically accomplished performers and skilled manipulators of their own bodies",1
" It is thus not so much an absence of skill or hostility toward tradition that defines conceptual art as an evident disregard for conventional, modern notions of authorial presence and of individual artistic expression",1
"


== Contemporary influence ==
Proto-conceptualism has roots in the rise of Modernism with, for example, Manet (1832–1883) and later Marcel Duchamp (1887–1968)",1
" The first wave of the ""conceptual art"" movement extended from approximately 1967
to 1978",1
" Early ""concept"" artists like Henry Flynt (1940– ), Robert Morris (1931–2018), and Ray Johnson (1927–1995) influenced the later, widely accepted movement of conceptual art",1
" Conceptual artists like Dan Graham, Hans Haacke, and Lawrence Weiner have proven very influential on subsequent artists, and well-known contemporary artists such as Mike Kelley or Tracey Emin are sometimes labeled ""second- or third-generation"" conceptualists, or ""post-conceptual"" artists (the prefix Post- in art can frequently be interpreted as ""because of"")",1
"
Contemporary artists have taken up many of the concerns of the conceptual art movement, while they may or may not term themselves ""conceptual artists""",1
" Ideas such as anti-commodification, social and/or political critique, and ideas/information as medium continue to be aspects of contemporary art, especially among artists working with installation art, performance art, art intervention, net",1
"art, and electronic/digital art",1
"

" La idea como arte: Duchamp, Beuys, Cage y Fluxus – PDF  UCMDrawing is a form of visual art in which an artist uses instruments to mark paper or other two-dimensional surface",1
" Drawing instruments include graphite pencils, pen and ink, various kinds of paints, inked brushes, colored pencils, crayons, charcoal, chalk, pastels, erasers, markers, styluses, and metals (such as silverpoint)",1
 Digital drawing is the act of drawing on graphics software in a computer,1
" Common methods of digital drawing include a stylus or finger on a touchscreen device, stylus- or finger-to-touchpad, or in some cases, a mouse",1
 There are many digital art programs and devices,1
"
A drawing instrument releases a small amount of material onto a surface, leaving a visible mark",1
" The most common support for drawing is paper, although other materials, such as cardboard, wood, plastic, leather, canvas, and board, have been used",1
 Temporary drawings may be made on a blackboard or whiteboard,1
 Drawing has been a popular and fundamental means of public expression throughout human history,1
 It is one of the simplest and most efficient means of communicating ideas,1
 The wide availability of drawing instruments makes drawing one of the most common artistic activities,1
"
In addition to its more artistic forms, drawing is frequently used in commercial illustration, animation, architecture, engineering, and technical drawing",1
" A quick, freehand drawing, usually not intended as a finished work, is sometimes called a sketch",1
" An artist who practices or works in technical drawing may be called a drafter, draftsman, or draughtsman",1
"


== Overview ==

Drawing is one of the oldest forms of human expression within the visual arts",1
" It is generally concerned with the marking of lines and areas of tone onto paper/other material, where the accurate representation of the visual world is expressed upon a plane surface",1
" Traditional drawings were monochrome, or at least had little colour, while modern colored-pencil drawings may approach or cross a boundary between drawing and painting",1
" In Western terminology, drawing is distinct from painting, even though similar media often are employed in both tasks",1
" Dry media, normally associated with drawing, such as chalk, may be used in pastel paintings",1
" Drawing may be done with a liquid medium, applied with brushes or pens",1
" Similar supports likewise can serve both: painting generally involves the application of liquid paint onto prepared canvas or panels, but sometimes an underdrawing is drawn first on that same support",1
"

Drawing is often exploratory, with considerable emphasis on observation, problem-solving and composition",1
" Drawing is also regularly used in preparation for a painting, further obfuscating their distinction",1
 Drawings created for these purposes are called studies,1
"There are several categories of drawing, including figure drawing, cartooning, doodling, and freehand",1
" There are also many drawing methods, such as line drawing, stippling, shading, the surrealist method of entopic graphomania (in which dots are made at the sites of impurities in a blank sheet of paper, and lines are then made between the dots), and tracing (drawing on a translucent paper, such as tracing paper, around the outline of preexisting shapes that show through the paper)",1
"
A quick, unrefined drawing may be called a sketch",1
"
In fields outside art, technical drawings or plans of buildings, machinery, circuitry and other things are often called ""drawings"" even when they have been transferred to another medium by printing",1
"


== History ==


=== In communication ===
Drawing is one of the oldest forms of human expression, with evidence for its existence preceding that of written communication",1
" It is believed that drawing was used as a specialised form of communication before the invention of the written language, demonstrated by the production of cave and rock paintings  around 30,000 years ago (Art of the Upper Paleolithic)",1
"
These drawings, known as pictograms, depicted objects and abstract concepts",1
 The sketches and paintings produced by Neolithic times were eventually stylised and simplified in to symbol systems (proto-writing) and eventually into early writing systems,1
"


=== In manuscripts ===
Before the widespread availability of paper, 12th-century monks in European monasteries used intricate drawings to prepare illustrated, illuminated manuscripts on vellum and parchment",1
" Drawing has also been used extensively in the field of science, as a method of discovery, understanding and explanation",1
"


=== In science ===
Drawing diagrams of observations is an important part of scientific study",1
"
In 1609, astronomer Galileo Galilei explained the changing phases of Venus and also the sunspots through his observational telescopic drawings",1
" In 1924, geophysicist Alfred Wegener used illustrations to visually demonstrate the origin of the continents",1
"


=== As artistic expression ===

Drawing is used to express one's creativity, and therefore has been prominent in the world of art",1
" Throughout much of history, drawing was regarded as the foundation for artistic practice",1
" Initially, artists used and reused wooden tablets for the production of their drawings",1
" Following the widespread availability of paper in the 14th century, the use of drawing in the arts increased",1
" At this point, drawing was commonly used as a tool for thought and investigation, acting as a study medium whilst artists were preparing for their final pieces of work",1
" The Renaissance brought about a great sophistication in drawing techniques, enabling artists to represent things more realistically than before, and revealing an interest in geometry and philosophy",1
The invention of the first widely available form of photography led to a shift in the hierarchy of the arts,1
" Photography offered an alternative to drawing as a method for accurately representing visual phenomena, and traditional drawing practice was given less emphasis as an essential skill for artists, particularly so in Western society",1
"


== Notable artists and draftsmen ==
Drawing became significant as an art form around the late 15th century, with artists and master engravers such as Albrecht Dürer and Martin Schongauer (c",1
" 1448-1491), the first Northern engraver known by name",1
" Schongauer came from Alsace, and was born into a family of goldsmiths",1
" Albrecht Dürer, a master of the next generation, was also the son of a goldsmith",1
"Old Master Drawings often reflect the history of the country in which they were produced, and the fundamental characteristics of a nation at that time",1
" In 17th-century Holland, a Protestant country, there were almost no religious artworks, and, with no King or court, most art was bought privately",1
 Drawings of landscapes or genre scenes were often viewed not as sketches but as highly finished works of art,1
" Italian drawings, however, show the influence of Catholicism and the Church, which played a major role in artistic patronage",1
" The same is often true of French drawings, although in the 17th century the disciplines of French Classicism meant drawings were less Baroque than the more free Italian counterparts, which conveyed a greater sense of movement",1
"In the 20th century Modernism encouraged ""imaginative originality"" and some artists' approach to drawing became less literal, more abstract",1
" World-renowned artists such as Pablo Picasso, Andy Warhol and Jean-Michel Basquiat helped challenge the status quo, with drawing being very much at the centre of their practice, and often re-interpreting traditional technique",1
"Basquiat's drawings were produced in many different mediums, most commonly ink, pencil, felt-tip or marker, and oil-stick, and he drew on any surface that came to hand, such as doors, clothing, refrigerators, walls and baseball helmets",1
"The centuries have produced a canon of notable artists and draftsmen, each with their own distinct language of drawing, including:

14th, 15th and 16th: Leonardo da Vinci • Albrecht Dürer • Hans Holbein the Younger • Michelangelo • Pisanello • Raphael

== Materials ==
The medium is the means by which ink, pigment or color are delivered onto the drawing surface",1
 Most drawing media are either dry (e,1
g,1
" graphite, charcoal, pastels, Conté, silverpoint), or use a fluid solvent or carrier (marker, pen and ink)",1
" Watercolor pencils can be used dry like ordinary pencils, then moistened with a wet brush to get various painterly effects",1
" Very rarely, artists have drawn with (usually decoded) invisible ink",1
 Metalpoint drawing usually employs either of two metals: silver or lead,1
" More rarely used are gold, platinum, copper, brass, bronze, and tinpoint",1
"
Paper comes in a variety of different sizes and qualities, ranging from newspaper grade up to high quality and relatively expensive paper sold as individual sheets",1
" Papers vary in texture, hue, acidity, and strength when wet",1
" Smooth paper is good for rendering fine detail, but a more ""toothy"" paper holds the drawing material better",1
 Thus a coarser material is useful for producing deeper contrast,1
"
Newsprint and typing paper may be useful for practice and rough sketches",1
" Tracing paper is used to experiment over a half-finished drawing, and to transfer a design from one sheet to another",1
 Cartridge paper is the basic type of drawing paper sold in pads,1
" Bristol board and even heavier acid-free boards, frequently with smooth finishes, are used for drawing fine detail and do not distort when wet media (ink, washes) are applied",1
 Vellum is extremely smooth and suitable for very fine detail,1
 Coldpressed watercolor paper may be favored for ink drawing due to its texture,1
"
Acid-free, archival quality paper keeps its color and texture far longer than wood pulp based paper such as newsprint, which turns yellow and becomes brittle much sooner",1
"
The basic tools are a drawing board or table, pencil sharpener and eraser, and for ink drawing, blotting paper",1
" Other tools used are circle compass, ruler, and set square",1
 Fixative is used to prevent pencil and crayon marks from smudging,1
" Drafting tape is used to secure paper to drawing surface, and also to mask an area to keep it free of accidental marks, such as sprayed or spattered materials and washes",1
" An easel or slanted table is used to keep the drawing surface in a suitable position, which is generally more horizontal than the position used in painting",1
"


== Technique ==

Almost all draftsmen use their hands and fingers to apply the media, with the exception of some handicapped individuals who draw with their mouth or feet",1
"Prior to working on an image, the artist typically explores how various media work",1
" They may try different drawing implements on practice sheets to determine value and texture, and how to apply the implement to produce various effects",1
"

The artist's choice of drawing strokes affects the appearance of the image",1
 Pen and ink drawings often use hatching – groups of parallel lines,1
 Cross-hatching uses hatching in two or more different directions to create a darker tone,1
" Broken hatching, or lines with intermittent breaks, form lighter tones –  and controlling the density of the breaks achieves a gradation of tone",1
" Stippling uses dots to produce tone, texture and shade",1
 Different textures can be achieved depending on the method used to build tone,1
"Drawings in dry media often use similar techniques, though pencils and drawing sticks can achieve continuous variations in tone",1
 Typically a drawing is filled in based on which hand the artist favors,1
 A right-handed artist draws from left to right to avoid smearing the image,1
" Erasers can remove unwanted lines, lighten tones, and clean up stray marks",1
" In a sketch or outline drawing, lines drawn often follow the contour of the subject, creating depth by looking like shadows cast from a light in the artist's position",1
"
Sometimes the artist leaves a section of the image untouched while filling in the remainder",1
" The shape of the area to preserve can be painted with masking fluid or cut out of a frisket and applied to the drawing surface, protecting the surface from stray marks until the mask is removed",1
"
Another method to preserve a section of the image is to apply a spray-on fixative to the surface",1
 This holds loose material more firmly to the sheet and prevents it from smearing,1
" However the fixative spray typically uses chemicals that can harm the respiratory system, so it should be employed in a well-ventilated area such as outdoors",1
"
Another technique is subtractive drawing in which the drawing surface is covered with graphite or charcoal and then erased to make the image",1
"


== Tone ==

Shading is the technique of varying the tonal values on the paper to represent the shade of the material as well as the placement of the shadows",1
" Careful attention to reflected light, shadows and highlights can result in a very realistic rendition of the image",1
"
Blending uses an implement to soften or spread the original drawing strokes",1
" Blending is most easily done with a medium that does not immediately fix itself, such as graphite, chalk, or charcoal, although freshly applied ink can be smudged, wet or dry, for some effects",1
" For shading and blending, the artist can use a blending stump, tissue, a kneaded eraser, a fingertip, or any combination of them",1
" A piece of chamois is useful for creating smooth textures, and for removing material to lighten the tone",1
" Continuous tone can be achieved with graphite on a smooth surface without blending, but the technique is laborious, involving small circular or oval strokes with a somewhat blunt point",1
"
Shading techniques that also introduce texture to the drawing include hatching and stippling",1
 A number of other methods produce texture,1
" In addition to the choice of paper, drawing material and technique affect texture",1
 Texture can be made to appear more realistic when it is drawn next to a contrasting texture; a coarse texture is more obvious when placed next to a smoothly blended area,1
 A similar effect can be achieved by drawing different tones close together,1
" A light edge next to a dark background stands out to the eye, and almost appears to float above the surface",1
"


== Form and proportion ==

Measuring the dimensions of a subject while blocking in the drawing is an important step in producing a realistic rendition of the subject",1
 Tools such as a compass can be used to measure the angles of different sides,1
 These angles can be reproduced on the drawing surface and then rechecked to make sure they are accurate,1
 Another form of measurement is to compare the relative sizes of different parts of the subject with each other,1
 A finger placed at a point along the drawing implement can be used to compare that dimension with other parts of the image,1
 A ruler can be used both as a straightedge and a device to compute proportions,1
"

When attempting to draw a complicated shape such as a human figure, it is helpful at first to represent the form with a set of primitive volumes",1
" Almost any form can be represented by some combination of the cube, sphere, cylinder, and cone",1
" Once these basic volumes have been assembled into a likeness, then the drawing can be refined into a more accurate and polished form",1
 The lines of the primitive volumes are removed and replaced by the final likeness,1
" Drawing the underlying construction is a fundamental skill for representational art, and is taught in many books and schools",1
" Its correct application resolves most uncertainties about smaller details, and makes the final image look consistent",1
A more refined art of figure drawing relies upon the artist possessing a deep understanding of anatomy and the human proportions,1
" A trained artist is familiar with the skeleton structure, joint location, muscle placement, tendon movement, and how the different parts work together during movement",1
 This allows the artist to render more natural poses that do not appear artificially stiff,1
" The artist is also familiar with how the proportions vary depending on the age of the subject, particularly when drawing a portrait",1
"


== Perspective ==

Linear perspective is a method of portraying objects on a flat surface so that the dimensions shrink with distance",1
" Each set of parallel, straight edges of any object, whether a building or a table, follows lines that eventually converge at a vanishing point",1
" Typically this convergence point is somewhere along the horizon, as buildings are built level with the flat surface",1
" When multiple structures are aligned with each other, such as buildings along a street, the horizontal tops and bottoms of the structures typically converge at a vanishing point",1
"
When both the fronts and sides of a building are drawn, then the parallel lines forming a side converge at a second point along the horizon (which may be off the drawing paper",1
) This is a two-point perspective,1
 Converging the vertical lines to a third point above or below the horizon then produces a three-point perspective,1
"

Depth can also be portrayed by several techniques in addition to the perspective approach above",1
 Objects of similar size should appear ever smaller the further they are from the viewer,1
 Thus the back wheel of a cart appears slightly smaller than the front wheel,1
 Depth can be portrayed through the use of texture,1
" As the texture of an object gets further away it becomes more compressed and busy, taking on an entirely different character than if it was close",1
" Depth can also be portrayed by reducing the contrast in more distant objects, and by making their colors less saturated",1
" This reproduces the effect of atmospheric haze, and cause the eye to focus primarily on objects drawn in the foreground",1
"


== Artistry ==

The composition of the image is an important element in producing an interesting work of artistic merit",1
 The artist plans element placement in the art to communicate ideas and feelings with the viewer,1
" The composition can determine the focus of the art, and result in a harmonious whole that is aesthetically appealing and stimulating",1
"
The illumination of the subject is also a key element in creating an artistic piece, and the interplay of light and shadow is a valuable method in the artist's toolbox",1
 The placement of the light sources can make a considerable difference in the type of message that is being presented,1
" Multiple light sources can wash out any wrinkles in a person's face, for instance, and give a more youthful appearance",1
" In contrast, a single light source, such as harsh daylight, can serve to highlight any texture or interesting features",1
"
When drawing an object or figure, the skilled artist pays attention to both the area within the silhouette and what lies outside",1
" The exterior is termed the negative space, and can be as important in the representation as the figure",1
 Objects placed in the background of the figure should appear properly placed wherever they can be viewed,1
"
A study is a draft drawing that is made in preparation for a planned final image",1
" Studies can be used to determine the appearances of specific parts of the completed image, or for experimenting with the best approach for accomplishing the end goal",1
" However a well-crafted study can be a piece of art in its own right, and many hours of careful work can go into completing a study",1
"


== Process ==
Individuals display differences in their ability to produce visually accurate drawings",1
" A visually accurate drawing is described as being ""recognized as a particular object at a particular time and in a particular space, rendered with little addition of visual detail that can not be seen in the object represented or with little deletion of visual detail”",1
Investigative studies have aimed to explain the reasons why some individuals draw better than others,1
"
One study posited four key abilities in the drawing process: motor skills required for mark-making, the drawer's own perception of their drawing, perception of objects being drawn, and the ability to make good representational decisions",1
" Following this hypothesis, several studies have sought to conclude which of these processes are most significant in affecting the accuracy of drawings",1
"

Motor controlMotor control is an important physical component in the 'Production Phase' of the drawing process",1
" It has been suggested that motor control plays a role in drawing ability, though its effects are not significant",1
"
PerceptionIt has been suggested that an individual's ability to perceive an object they are drawing is the most important stage in the drawing process",1
  This suggestion is supported by the discovery of a robust relationship between perception and drawing ability,1
"This evidence acted as the basis of Betty Edwards' how-to-draw book, Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain",1
" Edwards aimed to teach her readers how to draw, based on the development of the reader's perceptual abilities",1
"
Furthermore, the influential artist and art critic John Ruskin emphasised the importance of perception in the drawing process in his book The Elements of Drawing",1
"  He stated that ""For I am nearly convinced, that once we see keenly enough, there is very little difficult in drawing what we see""",1
"

Visual memoryThis has also been shown to influence one's ability to create visually accurate drawings",1
"
Short-term memory plays an important part in drawing as one's gaze shifts between the object they are drawing and the drawing itself",1
"
Decision-makingSome studies comparing artists to non-artists have found that artists spend more time thinking strategically while drawing",1
" In particular, artists spend more time on 'metacognitive' activities such as considering different hypothetical plans for how they might progress with a drawing",1
"

Ganesh drawing  is a popular drawing technique used in India that usually involves drawing a full-body illustration of Ganesh drawing is often practiced in the presence of Ganesh statues and devotees",1
"A photograph (also known as a photo, image, or picture) is an image created by light falling on a photosensitive surface, usually photographic film or an electronic image sensor, such as a CCD or a CMOS chip",1
" Most photographs are now created using a smartphone/camera, which uses a lens to focus the scene's visible wavelengths of light into a reproduction of what the human eye would see",1
 The process and practice of creating such images is called photography,1
"


== Etymology ==
The word photograph was coined in 1839 by Sir John Herschel and is based on the Greek φῶς (phos), meaning ""light,"" and γραφή (graphê), meaning ""drawing, writing,"" together meaning ""drawing with light",1
"""


== History ==

The first permanent photograph, a contact-exposed copy of an engraving, was made in 1822 using the bitumen-based ""heliography"" process developed by Nicéphore Niépce",1
" The first photographs of a real-world scene, made using a camera obscura, followed a few years later at Le Gras, France, in 1826, but Niépce's process was not sensitive enough to be practical for that application: a camera exposure lasting for hours or days was required",1
 In 1829 Niépce entered into a partnership with Louis Daguerre and the two collaborated to work out a similar but more sensitive and otherwise improved process,1
"

After Niépce's death in 1833 Daguerre concentrated on silver halide-based alternatives",1
" He exposed a silver-plated copper sheet to iodine vapor, creating a layer of light-sensitive silver iodide; exposed it in the camera for a few minutes; developed the resulting invisible latent image to visibility with mercury fumes; then bathed the plate in a hot salt solution to remove the remaining silver iodide, making the results light-fast",1
" He named this first practical process for making photographs with a camera the daguerreotype, after himself",1
 Its existence was announced to the world on 7 January 1839 but working details were not made public until 19 August,1
" Other inventors soon made improvements which reduced the required exposure time from a few minutes to a few seconds, making portrait photography truly practical and widely popular",1
"
The daguerreotype had shortcomings, notably the fragility of the mirror-like image surface and the particular viewing conditions required to see the image properly",1
 Each was a unique opaque positive that could only be duplicated by copying it with a camera,1
 Inventors set about working out improved processes that would be more practical,1
" By the end of the 1850s the daguerreotype had been replaced by the less expensive and more easily viewed ambrotype and tintype, which made use of the recently introduced collodion process",1
" Glass plate collodion negatives used to make prints on albumen paper soon became the preferred photographic method and held that position for many years, even after the introduction of the more convenient gelatin process in 1871",1
" Refinements of the gelatin process have remained the primary black-and-white photographic process to this day, differing primarily in the sensitivity of the emulsion and the support material used, which was originally glass, then a variety of flexible plastic films, along with various types of paper for the final prints",1
"

Color photography is almost as old as black-and-white, with early experiments including John Herschel's Anthotype prints in 1842, the pioneering work of Louis Ducos du Hauron in the 1860s, and the Lippmann process unveiled in 1891, but for many years color photography remained little more than a laboratory curiosity",1
" It first became a widespread commercial reality with the introduction of Autochrome plates in 1907, but the plates were very expensive and not suitable for casual snapshot-taking with hand-held cameras",1
" The mid-1930s saw the introduction of Kodachrome and Agfacolor Neu, the first easy-to-use color films of the modern multi-layer chromogenic type",1
" These early processes produced transparencies for use in slide projectors and viewing devices, but color prints became increasingly popular after the introduction of chromogenic color print paper in the 1940s",1
" The needs of the motion picture industry generated a number of special processes and systems, perhaps the best-known being the now-obsolete three-strip Technicolor process",1
"


== Types of photographs ==

Non-digital photographs are produced with a two-step chemical process",1
 In the two-step process the light-sensitive film captures a negative image (colors and lights/darks are inverted),1
" To produce a positive image, the negative is most commonly transferred ('printed') onto photographic paper",1
 Printing the negative onto transparent film stock is used to manufacture motion picture films,1
"
Alternatively, the film is processed to invert the negative image, yielding positive transparencies",1
" Such positive images are usually mounted in frames, called slides",1
" Before recent advances in digital photography, transparencies were widely used by professionals because of their sharpness and accuracy of color rendition",1
 Most photographs published in magazines were taken on color transparency film,1
"
Originally, all photographs were monochromatic or hand-painted in color",1
" Although methods for developing color photos were available as early as 1861, they did not become widely available until the 1940s or 1950s, and even so, until the 1960s most photographs were taken in black and white",1
" Since then, color photography has dominated popular photography, although black and white is still used, being easier to develop than color",1
"
Panoramic format images can be taken with cameras like the Hasselblad Xpan on standard film",1
" Since the 1990s, panoramic photos have been available on the Advanced Photo System (APS) film",1
" APS was developed by several of the major film manufacturers to provide a film with different formats and computerized options available, though APS panoramas were created using a mask in panorama-capable cameras, far less desirable than a true panoramic camera, which achieves its effect through a wider film format",1
 APS has become less popular and has been discontinued,1
"
The advent of the microcomputer and digital photography has led to the rise of digital prints",1
" These prints are created from stored graphic formats such as JPEG, TIFF, and RAW",1
" The types of printers used include inkjet printers, dye-sublimation printer, laser printers, and thermal printers",1
" Inkjet prints are sometimes given the coined name ""Giclée""",1
"
The Web has been a popular medium for storing and sharing photos ever since the first photograph was published on the web by Tim Berners-Lee in 1992 (an image of the CERN house band Les Horribles Cernettes)",1
" Today popular sites such as Flickr, PhotoBucket and 500px are used by millions of people to share their pictures",1
"


== Preservation ==


=== Paper folders ===
Ideal photograph storage involves placing each photo in an individual folder constructed from buffered, or acid-free paper",1
 Buffered paper folders are especially recommended in cases when a photograph was previously mounted onto poor quality material or using an adhesive that will lead to even more acid creation,1
" Store photographs measuring 8x10 inches or smaller vertically along the longer edge of the photo in the buffered paper folder, within a larger archival box, and label each folder with relevant information to identify it",1
" The rigid nature of the folder protects the photo from slumping or creasing, as long as the box is not packed too tightly or under filled",1
 Folder larger photos or brittle photos stacked flat within archival boxes with other materials of comparable size,1
"


=== Polyester enclosures ===
The most stable of plastics used in photo preservation, polyester, does not generate any harmful chemical elements, nor does it have any capability to absorb acids generated by the photograph itself",1
" Polyester sleeves and encapsulation have been praised for their ability to protect the photograph from humidity and environmental pollution, slowing the reaction between the item and the atmosphere",1
" This is true, however the polyester just as frequently traps these elements next to the material it is intended to protect",1
" This is especially risky in a storage environment that experiences drastic fluctuations in humidity or temperature, leading to ferrotyping, or sticking of the photograph to the plastic",1
" Photographs sleeved or encapsulated in polyester cannot be stored vertically in boxes because they will slide down next to each other within the box, bending and folding, nor can the archivist write directly onto the polyester to identify the photograph",1
" Therefore, it is necessary to either stack polyester protected photographs horizontally within a box, or bind them in a three ring binder",1
"  Stacking the photos horizontally within a flat box will greatly reduce ease of access, and binders leave three sides of the photo exposed to the effects of light and do not support the photograph evenly on both sides, leading to slumping and bending within the binder",1
 The plastic used for enclosures has been manufactured to be as frictionless as possible to prevent scratching photos during insertion to the sleeves,1
" Unfortunately, the slippery nature of the enclosure generates a build-up of static electricity, which attracts dust and lint particles",1
" The static can attract the dust to the inside of the sleeve, as well, where it can scratch the photograph",1
" Likewise, these components that aid in insertion of the photo, referred to as slip agents, can break down and transfer from the plastic to the photograph, where they deposit as an oily film, attracting further lint and dust",1
" At this time, there is no test to evaluate the long-term effects of these components on photographs",1
" In addition, the plastic sleeves can develop kinks or creases in the surface, which will scratch away at the emulsion during handling",1
"


=== Handling and care ===
It is best to leave photographs lying flat on the table when viewing them",1
" Do not pick it up from a corner, or even from two sides and hold it at eye level",1
" Every time the photograph bends, even a little, this can break down the emulsion",1
" The very nature of enclosing a photograph in plastic encourages users to pick it up; users tend to handle plastic enclosed photographs less gently than non-enclosed photographs, simply because they feel the plastic enclosure makes the photo impervious to all mishandling",1
" As long as a photo is in its folder, there is no need to touch it; simply remove the folder from the box, lay it flat on the table, and open the folder",1
" If for some reason the researchers or archivists do need to handle the actual photo, perhaps to examine the verso for writing, they can use gloves if there appears to be a risk from oils or dirt on the hands",1
"


== Myths and beliefs ==

Because daguerreotypes were rendered on a mirrored surface, many spiritualists also became practitioners of the new art form",1
  Spiritualists would claim that the human image on the mirrored surface was akin to looking into one's soul,1
 The spiritualists also believed that it would open their souls and let demons in,1
" Among Muslims, it is makruh (disliked) to perform salah (worship) in a place decorated with photographs",1
 Photography and darkroom anomalies and artifacts sometimes lead viewers to believe that spirits or demons have been captured in photos,1
"


== Legality ==

The production or distribution of certain types of photograph has been forbidden under modern laws, such as those of government buildings, highly classified regions, private property, copyrighted works, children's genitalia, child pornography and less commonly pornography overall",1
 These laws vary greatly between jurisdictions,1

 The dictionary definition of photograph at WiktionarySculpture is the branch of the visual arts that operates in three dimensions",1
" Sculpture is the three-dimensional art work which is physically presented in the dimensions of height, width and depth",1
 It is one of the plastic arts,1
" Durable sculptural processes originally used carving (the removal of material) and modelling (the addition of material, as clay), in stone, metal, ceramics, wood and other materials but, since Modernism, there has been almost complete freedom of materials and process",1
" A wide variety of materials may be worked by removal such as carving, assembled by welding or modelling, or moulded or cast",1
"
Sculpture in stone survives far better than works of art in perishable materials, and often represents the majority of the surviving works (other than pottery) from ancient cultures, though conversely traditions of sculpture in wood may have vanished almost entirely",1
" However, most ancient sculpture was brightly painted, and this has been lost",1
"Sculpture has been central in religious devotion in many cultures, and until recent centuries, large sculptures, too expensive for private individuals to create, were usually an expression of religion or politics",1
" Those cultures whose sculptures have survived in quantities include the cultures of the ancient Mediterranean, India and China, as well as many in Central and South America and Africa",1
"
The Western tradition of sculpture began in ancient Greece, and Greece is widely seen as producing great masterpieces in the classical period",1
" During the Middle Ages, Gothic sculpture represented the agonies and passions of the Christian faith",1
 The revival of classical models in the Renaissance produced famous sculptures such as Michelangelo's statue of David,1
" Modernist sculpture moved away from traditional processes and the emphasis on the depiction of the human body, with the making of constructed sculpture, and the presentation of found objects as finished artworks",1
"


== Types ==
A basic distinction is between sculpture ""in the round"", free-standing sculpture such as statues, not attached (except possibly at the base) to any other surface, and the various types of relief, which are at least partly attached to a background surface",1
" Relief is often classified by the degree of projection from the wall into low or bas-relief, high relief, and sometimes an intermediate mid-relief",1
 Sunk-relief is a technique restricted to ancient Egypt,1
" Relief is the usual sculptural medium for large figure groups and narrative subjects, which are difficult to accomplish in the round, and is the typical technique used both for architectural sculpture, which is attached to buildings, and for small-scale sculpture decorating other objects, as in much pottery, metalwork and jewellery",1
" Relief sculpture may also decorate steles, upright slabs, usually of stone, often also containing inscriptions",1
"
Another basic distinction is between subtractive carving techniques, which remove material from an existing block or lump, for example of stone or wood, and modelling techniques which shape or build up the work from the material",1
" Techniques such as casting, stamping and moulding use an intermediate matrix containing the design to produce the work; many of these allow the production of several copies",1
"

The term ""sculpture"" is often used mainly to describe large works, which are sometimes called monumental sculpture, meaning either or both of sculpture that is large, or that is attached to a building",1
" But the term properly covers many types of small works in three dimensions using the same techniques, including coins and medals, hardstone carvings, a term for small carvings in stone that can take detailed work",1
"
The very large or ""colossal"" statue has had an enduring appeal since antiquity; the largest on record at 182 m (597 ft) is the 2018 Indian Statue of Unity",1
" Another grand form of portrait sculpture is the equestrian statue of a rider on horse, which has become rare in recent decades",1
" The smallest forms of life-size portrait sculpture are the ""head"", showing just that, or the bust, a representation of a person from the chest up",1
" Small forms of sculpture include the figurine, normally a statue that is no more than 18 inches (46 cm) tall, and for reliefs the plaquette, medal or coin",1
"
Modern and contemporary art have added a number of non-traditional forms of sculpture, including sound sculpture, light sculpture, environmental art, environmental sculpture, street art sculpture, kinetic sculpture (involving aspects of physical motion), land art, and site-specific art",1
 Sculpture is an important form of public art,1
 A collection of sculpture in a garden setting can be called a sculpture garden,1
" There is also a view that buildings are a type of sculpture, with Constantin Brâncuși describing architecture as ""inhabited sculpture""",1

One of the most common purposes of sculpture is in some form of association with religion",1
" Cult images are common in many cultures, though they are often not the colossal statues of deities which characterized ancient Greek art, like the Statue of Zeus at Olympia",1
" The actual cult images in the innermost sanctuaries of Egyptian temples, of which none have survived, were evidently rather small, even in the largest temples",1
" The same is often true in Hinduism, where the very simple and ancient form of the lingam is the most common",1
" Buddhism brought the sculpture of religious figures to East Asia, where there seems to have been no earlier equivalent tradition, though again simple shapes like the bi and cong probably had religious significance",1
"
Small sculptures as personal possessions go back to the earliest prehistoric art, and the use of very large sculpture as public art, especially to impress the viewer with the power of a ruler, goes back at least to the Great Sphinx of some 4,500 years ago",1
" In archaeology and art history the appearance, and sometimes disappearance, of large or monumental sculpture in a culture is regarded as of great significance, though tracing the emergence is often complicated by the presumed existence of sculpture in wood and other perishable materials of which no record remains;The totem pole is an example of a tradition of monumental sculpture in wood that would leave no traces for archaeology",1
" The ability to summon the resources to create monumental sculpture, by transporting usually very heavy materials and arranging for the payment of what are usually regarded as full-time sculptors, is considered a mark of a relatively advanced culture in terms of social organization",1
" Recent unexpected discoveries of ancient Chinese Bronze Age figures at Sanxingdui, some more than twice human size, have disturbed many ideas held about early Chinese civilization, since only much smaller bronzes were previously known",1
"Some undoubtedly advanced cultures, such as the Indus Valley civilization, appear to have had no monumental sculpture at all, though producing very sophisticated figurines and seals",1
" The Mississippian culture seems to have been progressing towards its use, with small stone figures, when it collapsed",1
" Other cultures, such as ancient Egypt and the Easter Island culture, seem to have devoted enormous resources to very large-scale monumental sculpture from a very early stage",1
"

The collecting of sculpture, including that of earlier periods, goes back some 2,000 years in Greece, China and Mesoamerica, and many collections were available on semi-public display long before the modern museum was invented",1
" From the 20th century the relatively restricted range of subjects found in large sculpture expanded greatly, with abstract subjects and the use or representation of any type of subject now common",1
" Today much sculpture is made for intermittent display in galleries and museums, and the ability to transport and store the increasingly large works is a factor in their construction",1
" Small decorative figurines, most often in ceramics, are as popular today (though strangely neglected by modern and Contemporary art) as they were in the Rococo, or in ancient Greece when Tanagra figurines were a major industry, or in East Asian and Pre-Columbian art",1
" Small sculpted fittings for furniture and other objects go well back into antiquity, as in the Nimrud ivories, Begram ivories and finds from the tomb of Tutankhamun",1
"
Portrait sculpture began in Egypt, where the Narmer Palette shows a ruler of the 32nd century BCE, and Mesopotamia, where we have 27 surviving statues of Gudea, who ruled Lagash c",1
 2144–2124 BCE,1
" In ancient Greece and Rome, the erection of a portrait statue in a public place was almost the highest mark of honour, and the ambition of the elite, who might also be depicted on a coin",1
" In other cultures such as Egypt and the Near East public statues were almost exclusively the preserve of the ruler, with other wealthy people only being portrayed in their tombs",1
" Rulers are typically the only people given portraits in Pre-Columbian cultures, beginning with the Olmec colossal heads of about 3,000 years ago",1
" East Asian portrait sculpture was entirely religious, with leading clergy being commemorated with statues, especially the founders of monasteries, but not rulers, or ancestors",1
" The Mediterranean tradition revived, initially only for tomb effigies and coins, in the Middle Ages, but expanded greatly in the Renaissance, which invented new forms such as the personal portrait medal",1
"
Animals are, with the human figure, the earliest subject for sculpture, and have always been popular, sometimes realistic, but often imaginary monsters; in China animals and monsters are almost the only traditional subjects for stone sculpture outside tombs and temples",1
" The kingdom of plants is important only in jewellery and decorative reliefs, but these form almost all the large sculpture of Byzantine art and Islamic art, and are very important in most Eurasian traditions, where motifs such as the palmette and vine scroll have passed east and west for over two millennia",1
"
One form of sculpture found in many prehistoric cultures around the world is specially enlarged versions of ordinary tools, weapons or vessels created in impractical precious materials, for either some form of ceremonial use or display or as offerings",1
" Jade or other types of greenstone were used in China, Olmec Mexico, and Neolithic Europe, and in early Mesopotamia large pottery shapes were produced in stone",1
" Bronze was used in Europe and China for large axes and blades, like the Oxborough Dirk",1
"


== Materials and techniques ==

The materials used in sculpture are diverse, changing throughout history",1
" The classic materials, with outstanding durability, are metal, especially bronze, stone and pottery, with wood, bone and antler less durable but cheaper options",1
" Precious materials such as gold, silver, jade, and ivory are often used for small luxury works, and sometimes in larger ones, as in chryselephantine statues",1
" More common and less expensive materials were used for sculpture for wider consumption, including hardwoods (such as oak, box/boxwood, and lime/linden); terracotta and other ceramics, wax (a very common material for models for casting, and receiving the impressions of cylinder seals and engraved gems), and cast metals such as pewter and zinc (spelter)",1
" But a vast number of other materials have been used as part of sculptures, in ethnographic and ancient works as much as modern ones",1
"
Sculptures are often painted, but commonly lose their paint to time, or restorers",1
" Many different painting techniques have been used in making sculpture, including tempera, oil painting, gilding, house paint, aerosol, enamel and sandblasting",1
Many sculptors seek new ways and materials to make art,1
 One of Pablo Picasso's most famous sculptures included bicycle parts,1
 Alexander Calder and other modernists made spectacular use of painted steel,1
" Since the 1960s, acrylics and other plastics have been used as well",1
 Andy Goldsworthy makes his unusually ephemeral sculptures from almost entirely natural materials in natural settings,1
" Some sculpture, such as ice sculpture, sand sculpture, and gas sculpture, is deliberately short-lived",1
" Recent sculptors have used stained glass, tools, machine parts, hardware and consumer packaging to fashion their works",1
" Sculptors sometimes use found objects, and Chinese scholar's rocks have been appreciated for many centuries",1
"


=== Stone ===

Stone sculpture is an ancient activity where pieces of rough natural stone are shaped by the controlled removal of stone",1
" Owing to the permanence of the material, evidence can be found that even the earliest societies indulged in some form of stone work, though not all areas of the world have such abundance of good stone for carving as Egypt, Greece, India and most of Europe",1
" Petroglyphs (also called rock engravings) are perhaps the earliest form: images created by removing part of a rock surface which remains in situ, by incising, pecking, carving, and abrading",1
" Monumental sculpture covers large works, and architectural sculpture, which is attached to buildings",1
" Hardstone carving is the carving for artistic purposes of semi-precious stones such as jade, agate, onyx, rock crystal, sard or carnelian, and a general term for an object made in this way",1
 Alabaster or mineral gypsum is a soft mineral that is easy to carve for smaller works and still relatively durable,1
" Engraved gems are small carved gems, including cameos, originally used as seal rings",1
"
The copying of an original statue in stone, which was very important for ancient Greek statues, which are nearly all known from copies, was traditionally achieved by ""pointing"", along with more freehand methods",1
" Pointing involved setting up a grid of string squares on a wooden frame surrounding the original, and then measuring the position on the grid and the distance between grid and statue of a series of individual points, and then using this information to carve into the block from which the copy is made",1
"


=== Metal ===

Bronze and related copper alloys are the oldest and still the most popular metals for cast metal sculptures; a cast bronze sculpture is often called simply a ""bronze""",1
" Common bronze alloys have the unusual and desirable property of expanding slightly just before they set, thus filling the finest details of a mould",1
" Their strength and lack of brittleness (ductility) is an advantage when figures in action are to be created, especially when compared to various ceramic or stone materials (see marble sculpture for several examples)",1
" Gold is the softest and most precious metal, and very important in jewellery; with silver it is soft enough to be worked with hammers and other tools as well as cast; repoussé and chasing are among the techniques used in gold and silversmithing",1
"
Casting is a group of manufacturing processes by which a liquid material (bronze, copper, glass, aluminum, iron) is (usually) poured into a mould, which contains a hollow cavity of the desired shape, and then allowed to solidify",1
" The solid casting is then ejected or broken out to complete the process, although a final stage of ""cold work"" may follow on the finished cast",1
" Casting may be used to form hot liquid metals or various materials that cold set after mixing of components (such as epoxies, concrete, plaster and clay)",1
 Casting is most often used for making complex shapes that would be otherwise difficult or uneconomical to make by other methods,1
 The oldest surviving casting is a copper Mesopotamian frog from 3200 BCE,1
" Specific techniques include lost-wax casting, plaster mould casting and sand casting",1
"
Welding is a process where different pieces of metal are fused together to create different shapes and designs",1
" There are many different forms of welding, such as Oxy-fuel welding, Stick welding, MIG welding, and TIG welding",1
 Oxy-fuel is probably the most common method of welding when it comes to creating steel sculptures because it is the easiest to use for shaping the steel as well as making clean and less noticeable joins of the steel,1
 The key to Oxy-fuel welding is heating each piece of metal to be joined evenly until all are red and have a shine to them,1
" Once that shine is on each piece, that shine will soon become a 'pool' where the metal is liquified and the welder must get the pools to join, fusing the metal",1
" Once cooled off, the location where the pools joined are now one continuous piece of metal",1
 Also used heavily in Oxy-fuel sculpture creation is forging,1
 Forging is the process of heating metal to a certain point to soften it enough to be shaped into different forms,1
 One very common example is heating the end of a steel rod and hitting the red heated tip with a hammer while on an anvil to form a point,1
" In between hammer swings, the forger rotates the rod and gradually forms a sharpened point from the blunt end of a steel rod",1
"


=== Glass ===

Glass may be used for sculpture through a wide range of working techniques, though the use of it for large works is a recent development",1
" It can be carved, though with considerable difficulty; the Roman Lycurgus Cup is all but unique",1
"  There are various ways of moulding glass: hot casting can be done by ladling molten glass into moulds that have been created by pressing shapes into sand, carved graphite or detailed plaster/silica moulds",1
 Kiln casting glass involves heating chunks of glass in a kiln until they are liquid and flow into a waiting mould below it in the kiln,1
  Hot glass can also be blown and/or hot sculpted with hand tools either as a solid mass or as part of a blown object,1
 More recent techniques involve chiseling and bonding plate glass with polymer silicates and UV light,1
"


=== Pottery ===

Pottery is one of the oldest materials for sculpture, as well as clay being the medium in which many sculptures cast in metal are originally modelled for casting",1
" Sculptors often build small preliminary works called maquettes of ephemeral materials such as plaster of Paris, wax, unfired clay, or plasticine",1
"  Many cultures have produced pottery which combines a function as a vessel with a sculptural form, and small figurines have often been as popular as they are in modern Western culture",1
" Stamps and moulds were used by most ancient civilizations, from ancient Rome and Mesopotamia to China",1
"


=== Wood carving ===

Wood carving has been extremely widely practiced, but survives much less well than the other main materials, being vulnerable to decay, insect damage, and fire",1
 It therefore forms an important hidden element in the art history of many cultures,1
"  Outdoor wood sculpture does not last long in most parts of the world, so that we have little idea how the totem pole tradition developed",1
" Many of the most important sculptures of China and Japan in particular are in wood, and the great majority of African sculpture and that of Oceania and other regions",1
"
Wood is light, so suitable for masks and other sculpture intended to be carried, and can take very fine detail",1
 It is also much easier to work than stone,1
"  It has been very often painted after carving, but the paint wears less well than the wood, and is often missing in surviving pieces",1
"  Painted wood is often technically described as ""wood and polychrome""",1
"  Typically a layer of gesso or plaster is applied to the wood, and then the paint is applied to that",1
"


== Social status of sculptors ==

Worldwide, sculptors have usually been tradesmen whose work is unsigned; in some traditions, for example China, where sculpture did not share the prestige of literati painting, this has affected the status of sculpture itself",1
" Even in ancient Greece, where sculptors such as Phidias became famous, they appear to have retained much the same social status as other artisans, and perhaps not much greater financial rewards, although some signed their works",1
"  In the Middle Ages artists such as the 12th-century Gislebertus sometimes signed their work, and were sought after by different cities, especially from the Trecento onwards in Italy, with figures such as Arnolfo di Cambio, and Nicola Pisano and his son Giovanni",1
" Goldsmiths and jewellers, dealing with precious materials and often doubling as bankers, belonged to powerful guilds and had considerable status, often holding civic office",1
" Many sculptors also practised in other arts; Andrea del Verrocchio also painted, and Giovanni Pisano, Michelangelo, and Jacopo Sansovino were architects",1
 Some sculptors maintained large workshops,1
" Even in the Renaissance the physical nature of the work was perceived by Leonardo da Vinci and others as pulling down the status of sculpture in the arts, though the reputation of Michelangelo perhaps put this long-held idea to rest",1
"
From the High Renaissance artists such as Michelangelo, Leone Leoni and Giambologna could become wealthy, and ennobled, and enter the circle of princes, after a period of sharp argument over the relative status of sculpture and painting",1
"  Much decorative sculpture on buildings remained a trade, but sculptors producing individual pieces were recognised on a level with painters",1
" From the 18th century or earlier sculpture also attracted middle-class students, although it was slower to do so than painting",1
" Women sculptors took longer to appear than women painters, and were less prominent until the 20th century",1
"


== Anti-sculpture movements ==
Aniconism originated with Judaism, which did not accept figurative sculpture until the 19th century, before expanding to Christianity, which initially accepted large sculptures",1
" In Christianity and Buddhism, sculpture became very significant",1
" Christian Eastern Orthodoxy has never accepted monumental sculpture, and Islam has consistently rejected nearly all figurative sculpture, except for very small figures in reliefs and some animal figures that fulfill a useful function, like the famous lions supporting a fountain in the Alhambra",1
 Many forms of Protestantism also do not approve of religious sculpture,1
" There has been much iconoclasm of sculpture for religious motives, from the Early Christians and the Beeldenstorm of the Protestant Reformation to the 2001 destruction of the Buddhas of Bamyan by the Taliban",1
"


== History ==


=== Prehistoric periods ===


==== Europe ====

The earliest undisputed examples of sculpture belong to the Aurignacian culture, which was located in Europe and southwest Asia and active at the beginning of the Upper Paleolithic",1
" As well as producing some of the earliest known cave art, the people of this culture developed finely-crafted stone tools, manufacturing pendants, bracelets, ivory beads, and bone-flutes, as well as three-dimensional figurines",1
The 30 cm tall Löwenmensch found in the Hohlenstein Stadel area of Germany is an anthropomorphic lion-human figure carved from woolly mammoth ivory,1
" It has been dated to about 35–40,000 BP, making it, along with the Venus of Hohle Fels, the oldest known uncontested examples of sculpture",1
"Much surviving prehistoric art is small portable sculptures, with a small group of female Venus figurines such as the Venus of Willendorf (24–26,000 BP) found across central Europe",1
"  The Swimming Reindeer of about 13,000 years ago is one of the finest of a number of Magdalenian carvings in bone or antler of animals in the art of the Upper Paleolithic, although they are outnumbered by engraved pieces, which are sometimes classified as sculpture",1
" Two of the largest prehistoric sculptures can be found at the Tuc d'Audobert caves in France, where around 12–17,000 years ago a masterful sculptor used a spatula-like stone tool and fingers to model a pair of large bison in clay against a limestone rock",1
"With the beginning of the Mesolithic in Europe figurative sculpture greatly reduced, and remained a less common element in art than relief decoration of practical objects until the Roman period, despite some works such as the Gundestrup cauldron from the European Iron Age and the Bronze Age Trundholm sun chariot",1
"


==== Ancient Near East ====
From the ancient Near East, the over-life sized stone Urfa Man from modern Turkey comes from about 9,000 BCE, and the 'Ain Ghazal Statues from around 7200 and 6500 BCE",1
"  These are from modern Jordan, made of lime plaster and reeds, and about half life-size; there are 15 statues, some with two heads side by side, and 15 busts",1
"  Small clay figures of people and animals are found at many sites across the Near East from the Pre-Pottery Neolithic, and represent the start of a more-or-less continuous tradition in the region",1
"

		
		
		
		
		
		
		


=== Ancient Near East ===

The Protoliterate period in Mesopotamia, dominated by Uruk, saw the production of sophisticated works like the Warka Vase and cylinder seals",1
" The Guennol Lioness is an outstanding small limestone figure from Elam of about 3000–2800 BCE, part human and part lioness",1
" A little later there are a number of figures of large-eyed priests and worshippers, mostly in alabaster and up to a foot high, who attended temple cult images of the deity, but very few of these have survived",1
"  Sculptures from the Sumerian and Akkadian period generally had large, staring eyes, and long beards on the men",1
 Many masterpieces have also been found at the Royal Cemetery at Ur (c,1
" 2650 BCE), including the two figures of a Ram in a Thicket, the Copper Bull and a bull's head on one of the Lyres of Ur",1
"From the many subsequent periods before the ascendency of the Neo-Assyrian Empire in the 10th century BCE, Mesopotamian art survives in a number of forms: cylinder seals, relatively small figures in the round, and reliefs of various sizes, including cheap plaques of moulded pottery for the home, some religious and some apparently not",1
" The Burney Relief is an unusually elaborate and relatively large (20 x 15 inches, 50 x 37 cm) terracotta plaque of a naked winged goddess with the feet of a bird of prey, and attendant owls and lions",1
" It comes from the 18th or 19th century BCE, and may also be moulded",1
" Stone stelae, votive offerings, or ones probably commemorating victories and showing feasts, are also found from temples, which unlike more official ones lack inscriptions that would explain them; the fragmentary Stele of the Vultures is an early example of the inscribed type, and the Assyrian Black Obelisk of Shalmaneser III a large and solid late one",1
"The conquest of the whole of Mesopotamia and much surrounding territory by the Assyrians created a larger and wealthier state than the region had known before, and very grandiose art in palaces and public places, no doubt partly intended to match the splendour of the art of the neighbouring Egyptian empire",1
" Unlike earlier states, the Assyrians could use easily carved stone from northern Iraq, and did so in great quantity",1
"  The Assyrians developed a style of extremely large schemes of very finely detailed narrative low reliefs in stone for palaces, with scenes of war or hunting; the British Museum has an outstanding collection, including the Lion Hunt of Ashurbanipal and the Lachish reliefs showing a campaign",1
" They produced very little sculpture in the round, except for colossal guardian figures of the human-headed lamassu, which are sculpted in high relief on two sides of a rectangular block, with the heads effectively in the round (and also five legs, so that both views seem complete)",1
 Even before dominating the region they had continued the cylinder seal tradition with designs which are often exceptionally energetic and refined,1
"

		
		
		


=== Ancient Egypt ===

The monumental sculpture of ancient Egypt is world-famous, but refined and delicate small works exist in much greater numbers",1
" The Egyptians used the distinctive technique of sunk relief, which is well suited to very bright sunlight",1
" The main figures in reliefs adhere to the same figure convention as in painting, with parted legs (where not seated) and head shown from the side, but the torso from the front, and a standard set of proportions making up the figure, using 18 ""fists"" to go from the ground to the hair-line on the forehead",1
 This appears as early as the Narmer Palette from Dynasty I,1
" However, there as elsewhere the convention is not used for minor figures shown engaged in some activity, such as the captives and corpses",1
  Other conventions make statues of males darker than females ones,1
" Very conventionalized portrait statues appear from as early as Dynasty II, before 2,780 BCE, and with the exception of the art of the Amarna period of Ahkenaten, and some other periods such as Dynasty XII, the idealized features of rulers, like other Egyptian artistic conventions, changed little until after the Greek conquest",1
"Egyptian pharaohs were always regarded as deities, but other deities are much less common in large statues, except when they represent the pharaoh as another deity; however the other deities are frequently shown in paintings and reliefs",1
" The famous row of four colossal statues outside the main temple at Abu Simbel each show Rameses II, a typical scheme, though here exceptionally large",1
"  Small figures of deities, or their animal personifications, are very common, and found in popular materials such as pottery",1
 Most larger sculpture survives from Egyptian temples or tombs; by Dynasty IV (2680–2565 BCE) at the latest the idea of the Ka statue was firmly established,1
" These were put in tombs as a resting place for the ka portion of the soul, and so we have a good number of less conventionalized statues of well-off administrators and their wives, many in wood as Egypt is one of the few places in the world where the climate allows wood to survive over millennia",1
" The so-called reserve heads, plain hairless heads, are especially naturalistic",1
" Early tombs also contained small models of the slaves, animals, buildings and objects such as boats necessary for the deceased to continue his lifestyle in the afterworld, and later Ushabti figures",1
"

		
		
		
		
		
		
		


=== Europe ===


==== Ancient Greece ====

The first distinctive style of ancient Greek sculpture developed in the Early Bronze Age Cycladic period (3rd millennium BCE), where marble figures, usually female and small, are represented in an elegantly simplified geometrical style",1
" Most typical is a standing pose with arms crossed in front, but other figures are shown in different poses, including a complicated figure of a harpist seated on a chair",1
"The subsequent Minoan and Mycenaean cultures developed sculpture further, under influence from Syria and elsewhere, but it is in the later Archaic period from around 650 BCE that the kouros developed",1
" These are large standing statues of naked youths, found in temples and tombs, with the kore as the clothed female equivalent, with elaborately dressed hair; both have the ""archaic smile""",1
" They seem to have served a number of functions, perhaps sometimes representing deities and sometimes the person buried in a grave, as with the Kroisos Kouros",1
" They are clearly influenced by Egyptian and Syrian styles, but the Greek artists were much more ready to experiment within the style",1
"
During the 6th century Greek sculpture developed rapidly, becoming more naturalistic, and with much more active and varied figure poses in narrative scenes, though still within idealized conventions",1
" Sculptured pediments were added to temples, including the Parthenon in Athens, where the remains of the pediment of around 520 using figures in the round were fortunately used as infill for new buildings after the Persian sack in 480 BCE, and recovered from the 1880s on in fresh unweathered condition",1
" Other significant remains of architectural sculpture come from Paestum in Italy, Corfu, Delphi and the Temple of Aphaea in Aegina (much now in Munich)",1
"  Most Greek sculpture originally included at least some colour; the Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek Museum in Copenhagen, Denmark, has done extensive research and recreation of the original colours",1
"

		
		
		
		
		

		


===== Classical =====

There are fewer original remains from the first phase of the Classical period, often called the Severe style; free-standing statues were now mostly made in bronze, which always had value as scrap",1
" The Severe style lasted from around 500 in reliefs, and soon after 480 in statues, to about 450",1
" The relatively rigid poses of figures relaxed, and asymmetrical turning positions and oblique views became common, and deliberately sought",1
" This was combined with a better understanding of anatomy and the harmonious structure of sculpted figures, and the pursuit of naturalistic representation as an aim, which had not been present before",1
" Excavations at the Temple of Zeus, Olympia since 1829 have revealed the largest group of remains, from about 460, of which many are in the Louvre",1
"The ""High Classical"" period lasted only a few decades from about 450 to 400, but has had a momentous influence on art, and retains a special prestige, despite a very restricted number of original survivals",1
" The best known works are the Parthenon Marbles, traditionally (since Plutarch) executed by a team led by the most famous ancient Greek sculptor Phidias, active from about 465–425, who was in his own day more famous for his colossal chryselephantine Statue of Zeus at Olympia (c",1
" 432), one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, his Athena Parthenos (438), the cult image of the Parthenon, and Athena Promachos, a colossal bronze figure that stood next to the Parthenon; all of these are lost but are known from many representations",1
" He is also credited as the creator of some life-size bronze statues known only from later copies whose identification is controversial, including the Ludovisi Hermes",1
"The High Classical style continued to develop realism and sophistication in the human figure, and improved the depiction of drapery (clothes), using it to add to the impact of active poses",1
" Facial expressions were usually very restrained, even in combat scenes",1
 The composition of groups of figures in reliefs and on pediments combined complexity and harmony in a way that had a permanent influence on Western art,1
" Relief could be very high indeed, as in the Parthenon illustration below, where most of the leg of the warrior is completely detached from the background, as were the missing parts; relief this high made sculptures more subject to damage",1
" The Late Classical style developed the free-standing female nude statue, supposedly an innovation of Praxiteles, and developed increasingly complex and subtle poses that were interesting when viewed from a number of angles, as well as more expressive faces; both trends were to be taken much further in the Hellenistic period",1
"


===== Hellenistic =====

The Hellenistic period is conventionally dated from the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BCE, and ending either with the final conquest of the Greek heartlands by Rome in 146 BCE or with the final defeat of the last remaining successor-state to Alexander's empire after the Battle of Actium in 31 BCE, which also marks the end of Republican Rome",1
"  It is thus much longer than the previous periods, and includes at least two major phases: a ""Pergamene"" style of experimentation, exuberance and some sentimentality and vulgarity, and in the 2nd century BCE a classicising return to a more austere simplicity and elegance; beyond such generalizations dating is typically very uncertain, especially when only later copies are known, as is usually the case",1
" The initial Pergamene style was not especially associated with Pergamon, from which it takes its name, but the very wealthy kings of that state were among the first to collect and also copy Classical sculpture, and also commissioned much new work, including the famous Pergamon Altar whose sculpture is now mostly in Berlin and which exemplifies the new style, as do the   Mausoleum at Halicarnassus (another of the Seven Wonders), the famous Laocoön and his Sons in the Vatican Museums, a late example, and the bronze original of The Dying Gaul (illustrated at top), which we know was part of a group actually commissioned for Pergamon in about 228 BCE, from which the Ludovisi Gaul was also a copy",1
" The group called the Farnese Bull, possibly a 2nd-century marble original, is still larger and more complex,

Hellenistic sculpture greatly expanded the range of subjects represented, partly as a result of greater general prosperity, and the emergence of a very wealthy class who had large houses decorated with sculpture, although we know that some examples of subjects that seem best suited to the home, such as children with animals, were in fact placed in temples or other public places",1
" For a much more popular home decoration market there were Tanagra figurines, and those from other centres where small pottery figures were produced on an industrial scale, some religious but others showing animals and elegantly dressed ladies",1
" Sculptors became more technically skilled in representing facial expressions conveying a wide variety of emotions and the portraiture of individuals, as well representing different ages and races",1
" The reliefs from the Mausoleum are rather atypical in that respect; most work was free-standing, and group compositions with several figures to be seen in the round, like the Laocoon and the Pergamon group celebrating victory over the Gauls became popular, having been rare before",1
" The Barberini Faun, showing a satyr sprawled asleep, presumably after drink, is an example of the moral relaxation of the period, and the readiness to create large and expensive sculptures of subjects that fall short of the heroic",1
"After the conquests of Alexander Hellenistic culture was dominant in the courts of most of the Near East, and some of Central Asia, and increasingly being adopted by European elites, especially in Italy, where Greek colonies initially controlled most of the South",1
" Hellenistic art, and artists, spread very widely, and was especially influential in the expanding Roman Republic and when it encountered Buddhism in the easternmost extensions of the Hellenistic area",1
" The massive so-called Alexander Sarcophagus found in Sidon in modern Lebanon, was probably made there at the start of the period by expatriate Greek artists for a Hellenized Persian governor",1
"  The wealth of the period led to a greatly increased production of luxury forms of small sculpture, including engraved gems and cameos, jewellery, and gold and silverware",1
"

		
		
		
		
		
		
		


==== Europe after the Greeks ====


===== Roman sculpture =====

Early Roman art was influenced by the art of Greece and that of the neighbouring Etruscans, themselves greatly influenced by their Greek trading partners",1
" An Etruscan speciality was near life size tomb effigies in terracotta, usually lying on top of a sarcophagus lid propped up on one elbow in the pose of a diner in that period",1
" As the expanding Roman Republic began to conquer Greek territory, at first in Southern Italy and then the entire Hellenistic world except for the Parthian far east, official and patrician sculpture became largely an extension of the Hellenistic style, from which specifically Roman elements are hard to disentangle, especially as so much Greek sculpture survives only in copies of the Roman period",1
" By the 2nd century BCE, ""most of the sculptors working at Rome"" were Greek, often enslaved in conquests such as that of Corinth (146 BCE), and sculptors continued to be mostly Greeks, often slaves, whose names are very rarely recorded",1
" Vast numbers of Greek statues were imported to Rome, whether as booty or the result of extortion or commerce, and temples were often decorated with re-used Greek works",1
"A native Italian style can be seen in the tomb monuments, which very often featured portrait busts, of prosperous middle-class Romans, and portraiture is arguably the main strength of Roman sculpture",1
" There are no survivals from the tradition of masks of ancestors that were worn in processions at the funerals of the great families and otherwise displayed in the home, but many of the busts that survive must represent ancestral figures, perhaps from the large family tombs like the Tomb of the Scipios or the later mausolea outside the city",1
" The famous bronze head supposedly of Lucius Junius Brutus is very variously dated, but taken as a very rare survival of Italic style under the Republic, in the preferred medium of bronze",1
" Similarly stern and forceful heads are seen on coins of the Late Republic, and in the Imperial period coins as well as busts sent around the Empire to be placed in the basilicas of provincial cities were the main visual form of imperial propaganda; even Londinium had a near-colossal statue of Nero, though far smaller than the 30-metre-high Colossus of Nero in Rome, now lost",1
"

The Romans did not generally attempt to compete with free-standing Greek works of heroic exploits from history or mythology, but from early on produced historical works in relief, culminating in the great Roman triumphal columns with continuous narrative reliefs winding around them, of which those commemorating Trajan (CE 113) and Marcus Aurelius (by 193) survive in Rome, where the Ara Pacis (""Altar of Peace"", 13 BCE) represents the official Greco-Roman style at its most classical and refined",1
" Among other major examples are the earlier re-used reliefs on the Arch of Constantine and the base of the Column of Antoninus Pius (161), Campana reliefs were cheaper pottery versions of marble reliefs and the taste for relief was from the imperial period expanded to the sarcophagus",1
" All forms of luxury small sculpture continued to be patronized, and quality could be extremely high, as in the silver Warren Cup, glass Lycurgus Cup, and large cameos like the Gemma Augustea, Gonzaga Cameo and the ""Great Cameo of France""",1
"  For a much wider section of the population, moulded relief decoration of pottery vessels and small figurines were produced in great quantity and often considerable quality",1
"After moving through a late 2nd-century ""baroque"" phase, in the 3rd century, Roman art largely abandoned, or simply became unable to produce, sculpture in the classical tradition, a change whose causes remain much discussed",1
" Even the most important imperial monuments now showed stumpy, large-eyed figures in a harsh frontal style, in simple compositions emphasizing power at the expense of grace",1
" The contrast is famously illustrated in the Arch of Constantine of 315 in Rome, which combines sections in the new style with roundels in the earlier full Greco-Roman style taken from elsewhere, and the Four Tetrarchs (c",1
" 305) from the new capital of Constantinople, now in Venice",1
" Ernst Kitzinger found in both monuments the same ""stubby proportions, angular movements, an ordering of parts through symmetry and repetition and a rendering of features and drapery folds through incisions rather than modelling",1
,1
,1
" The hallmark of the style wherever it appears consists of an emphatic hardness, heaviness and angularity—in short, an almost complete rejection of the classical tradition""",1
"This revolution in style shortly preceded the period in which Christianity was adopted by the Roman state and the great majority of the people, leading to the end of large religious sculpture, with large statues now only used for emperors",1
" However, rich Christians continued to commission reliefs for sarcophagi, as in the Sarcophagus of Junius Bassus, and very small sculpture, especially in ivory, was continued by Christians, building on the style of the consular diptych",1
"

		
		
		
		
		
		
		


===== Early Medieval and Byzantine =====

The Early Christians were opposed to monumental religious sculpture, though continuing Roman traditions in portrait busts and sarcophagus reliefs, as well as smaller objects such as the consular diptych",1
" Such objects, often in valuable materials, were also the main sculptural traditions (as far as is known) of the barbaric civilizations of the Migration period, as seen in the objects found in the 6th-century burial treasure at Sutton Hoo, and the jewellery of Scythian art and the hybrid Christian and animal style productions of Insular art",1
" Following the continuing Byzantine tradition, Carolingian art revived ivory carving, often in panels for the treasure bindings of grand illuminated manuscripts, as well as crozier heads and other small fittings",1
"
Byzantine art, though producing superb ivory reliefs and architectural decorative carving, never returned to monumental sculpture, or even much small sculpture in the round",1
"  However, in the West during the Carolingian and Ottonian periods there was the beginnings of a production of monumental statues, in courts and major churches",1
" This gradually spread; by the late 10th and 11th century there are records of several apparently life-size sculptures in Anglo-Saxon churches, probably of precious metal around a wooden frame, like the Golden Madonna of Essen",1
" No Anglo-Saxon example has survived, and survivals of large non-architectural sculpture from before 1,000 are exceptionally rare",1
" Much the finest is the Gero Cross, of 965–970, which is a crucifix, which was evidently the commonest type of sculpture; Charlemagne had set one up in the Palatine Chapel in Aachen around 800",1
" These continued to grow in popularity, especially in Germany and Italy",1
" The runestones of the Nordic world, the Pictish stones of Scotland and possibly the high cross reliefs of Christian Great Britain, were northern sculptural traditions that bridged the period of Christianization",1
"

		
		


===== Romanesque =====

From about 1000 there was a general rebirth of artistic production in all Europe, led by general economic growth in production and commerce, and the new style of Romanesque art was the first medieval style to be used in the whole of Western Europe",1
" The new cathedrals and pilgrim's churches were increasingly decorated with architectural stone reliefs, and new focuses for sculpture developed, such as the tympanum over church doors in the 12th century, and the inhabited capital with figures and often narrative scenes",1
 Outstanding abbey churches with sculpture include in France Vézelay and Moissac and in Spain Silos,1
Romanesque art was characterised by a very vigorous style in both sculpture and painting,1
" The capitals of columns were never more exciting than in this period, when they were often carved with complete scenes with several figures",1
"  The large wooden crucifix was a German innovation right at the start of the period, as were free-standing statues of the enthroned Madonna, but the high relief was above all the sculptural mode of the period",1
" Compositions usually had little depth, and needed to be flexible to squeeze themselves into the shapes of capitals, and church typanums; the tension between a tightly enclosing frame, from which the composition sometimes escapes, is a recurrent theme in Romanesque art",1
 Figures still often varied in size in relation to their importance portraiture hardly existed,1
"

Objects in precious materials such as ivory and metal had a very high status in the period, much more so than monumental sculpture — we know the names of more makers of these than painters, illuminators or architect-masons",1
" Metalwork, including decoration in enamel, became very sophisticated, and many spectacular shrines made to hold relics have survived, of which the best known is the Shrine of the Three Kings at Cologne Cathedral by Nicholas of Verdun",1
" The bronze Gloucester candlestick and the brass font of 1108–17 now in Liège are superb examples, very different in style, of metal casting, the former highly intricate and energetic, drawing on manuscript painting, while the font shows the Mosan style at its most classical and majestic",1
" The bronze doors, a triumphal column and other fittings at Hildesheim Cathedral, the Gniezno Doors, and the doors of the Basilica di San Zeno in Verona are other substantial survivals",1
" The aquamanile, a container for water to wash with, appears to have been introduced to Europe in the 11th century, and often took fantastic zoomorphic forms; surviving examples are mostly in brass",1
" Many wax impressions from impressive seals survive on charters and documents, although Romanesque coins are generally not of great aesthetic interest",1
"The Cloisters Cross is an unusually large ivory crucifix, with complex carving including many figures of prophets and others, which has been attributed to one of the relatively few artists whose name is known, Master Hugo, who also illuminated manuscripts",1
 Like many pieces it was originally partly coloured,1
" The Lewis chessmen are well-preserved examples of small ivories, of which many pieces or fragments remain from croziers, plaques, pectoral crosses and similar objects",1
"

		
		
		


===== Gothic =====

The Gothic period is essentially defined by Gothic architecture, and does not entirely fit with the development of style in sculpture in either its start or finish",1
" The facades of large churches, especially around doors, continued to have large typanums, but also rows of sculpted figures spreading around them",1
 The statues on the Western (Royal) Portal at Chartres Cathedral (c,1
" 1145) show an elegant but exaggerated columnar elongation, but those on the south transept portal, from 1215 to 1220, show a more naturalistic style and increasing detachment from the wall behind, and some awareness of the classical tradition",1
" These trends were continued in the west portal at Reims Cathedral of a few years later, where the figures are almost in the round, as became usual as Gothic spread across Europe",1
"In Italy Nicola Pisano (1258–1278) and his son Giovanni developed a style that is often called Proto-Renaissance, with unmistakable influence from Roman sarcophagi and sophisticated and crowded compositions, including a sympathetic handling of nudity, in relief panels on their pulpit of Siena Cathedral (1265–68), the Fontana Maggiore in Perugia, and Giovanni's pulpit in Pistoia of 1301",1
  Another revival of classical style is seen in the International Gothic work of Claus Sluter and his followers in Burgundy and Flanders around 1400,1
"  Late Gothic sculpture continued in the North, with a fashion for very large wooden sculpted altarpieces with increasingly virtuoso carving and large numbers agitated expressive figures; most surviving examples are in Germany, after much iconoclasm elsewhere",1
" Tilman Riemenschneider, Veit Stoss and others continued the style well into the 16th century, gradually absorbing Italian Renaissance influences",1
"Life-size tomb effigies in stone or alabaster became popular for the wealthy, and grand multi-level tombs evolved, with the Scaliger Tombs of Verona so large they had to be moved outside the church",1
 By the 15th century there was an industry exporting Nottingham alabaster altar reliefs in groups of panels over much of Europe for economical parishes who could not afford stone retables,1
"  Small carvings, for a mainly lay and often female market, became a considerable industry in Paris and some other centres",1
" Types of ivories included small devotional polyptychs, single figures, especially of the Virgin, mirror-cases, combs, and elaborate caskets with scenes from Romances, used as engagement presents",1
"  The very wealthy collected extravagantly elaborate jewelled and enamelled metalwork, both secular and religious, like the Duc de Berry's Holy Thorn Reliquary, until they ran short of money, when they were melted down again for cash",1
"

		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		


==== Renaissance ====

Renaissance sculpture proper is often taken to begin with the famous competition for the doors of the Florence Baptistry in 1403, from which the trial models submitted by the winner, Lorenzo Ghiberti, and Filippo Brunelleschi survive",1
" Ghiberti's doors are still in place, but were undoubtedly eclipsed by his second pair for the other entrance, the so-called Gates of Paradise, which took him from 1425 to 1452, and are dazzlingly confident classicizing compositions with varied depths of relief allowing extensive backgrounds",1
" The intervening years had seen Ghiberti's early assistant Donatello develop with seminal statues including his Davids in marble (1408–09) and bronze (1440s), and his Equestrian statue of Gattamelata, as well as reliefs",1
" A leading figure in the later period was Andrea del Verrocchio, best known for his equestrian statue of Bartolomeo Colleoni in Venice; his pupil Leonardo da Vinci designed an equine sculpture in 1482 The Horse for Milan, but only succeeded in making a 24-foot (7",1
"3 m) clay model which was destroyed by French archers in 1499, and his other ambitious sculptural plans were never completed",1
"The period was marked by a great increase in patronage of sculpture by the state for public art and by the wealthy for their homes; especially in Italy, public sculpture remains a crucial element in the appearance of historic city centres",1
 Church sculpture mostly moved inside just as outside public monuments became common,1
" Portrait sculpture, usually in busts, became popular in Italy around 1450, with the Neapolitan Francesco Laurana specializing in young women in meditative poses, while Antonio Rossellino and others more often depicted knobbly-faced men of affairs, but also young children",1
  The portrait medal invented by Pisanello also often depicted women; relief plaquettes were another new small form of sculpture in cast metal,1
"
Michelangelo was an active sculptor from about 1500 to 1520, and his great masterpieces including his David, Pietà, Moses, and pieces for the Tomb of Pope Julius II and Medici Chapel could not be ignored by subsequent sculptors",1
" His iconic David (1504) has a contrapposto pose, borrowed from classical sculpture",1
 It differs from previous representations of the subject in that David is depicted before his battle with Goliath and not after the giant's defeat,1
" Instead of being shown victorious, as Donatello and Verocchio had done, David looks tense and battle ready",1
"

		
		
		
		
		
		
		


==== Mannerist ====

As in painting, early Italian Mannerist sculpture was very largely an attempt to find an original style that would top the achievement of the High Renaissance, which in sculpture essentially meant Michelangelo, and much of the struggle to achieve this was played out in commissions to fill other places in the Piazza della Signoria in Florence, next to Michelangelo's David",1
" Baccio Bandinelli took over the project of Hercules and Cacus from the master himself, but it was little more popular than it is now, and maliciously compared by Benvenuto Cellini to ""a sack of melons"", though it had a long-lasting effect in apparently introducing relief panels on the pedestal of statues for the first time",1
" Like other works of his, and other Mannerists, it removes far more of the original block than Michelangelo would have done",1
"  Cellini's bronze Perseus with the head of Medusa is certainly a masterpiece, designed with eight angles of view, another Mannerist characteristic, but is indeed mannered compared to the Davids of Michelangelo and Donatello",1
"  Originally a goldsmith, his famous gold and enamel Salt Cellar (1543) was his first sculpture, and shows his talent at its best",1
"  As these examples show, the period extended the range of secular subjects for large works beyond portraits, with mythological figures especially favoured; previously these had mostly been found in small works",1
"
Small bronze figures for collector's cabinets, often mythological subjects with nudes, were a popular Renaissance form at which Giambologna, originally Flemish but based in Florence, excelled in the later part of the century, also creating life-size sculptures, of which two joined the collection in the Piazza della Signoria",1
" He and his followers devised elegant elongated examples of the figura serpentinata, often of two intertwined figures, that were interesting from all angles",1
"

		
		
		


==== Baroque and Rococo ====

In Baroque sculpture, groups of figures assumed new importance, and there was a dynamic movement and energy of human forms— they spiralled around an empty central vortex, or reached outwards into the surrounding space",1
" Baroque sculpture often had multiple ideal viewing angles, and reflected a general continuation of the Renaissance move away from the relief to sculpture created in the round, and designed to be placed in the middle of a large space—elaborate fountains such as Bernini's Fontana dei Quattro Fiumi (Rome, 1651), or those in the Gardens of Versailles were a Baroque speciality",1
" The Baroque style was perfectly suited to sculpture, with Gian Lorenzo Bernini the dominating figure of the age in works such as The Ecstasy of St Theresa (1647–1652)",1
" Much Baroque sculpture added extra-sculptural elements, for example, concealed lighting, or water fountains, or fused sculpture and architecture to create a transformative experience for the viewer",1
" Artists saw themselves as in the classical tradition, but admired Hellenistic and later Roman sculpture, rather than that of the more ""Classical"" periods as they are seen today",1
"The Protestant Reformation brought an almost total stop to religious sculpture in much of Northern Europe, and though secular sculpture, especially for portrait busts and tomb monuments, continued, the Dutch Golden Age has no significant sculptural component outside goldsmithing",1
"  Partly in direct reaction, sculpture was as prominent in Roman Catholicism as in the late Middle Ages",1
 Statues of rulers and the nobility became increasingly popular,1
 In the 18th century much sculpture continued on Baroque lines—the Trevi Fountain was only completed in 1762,1
" Rococo style was better suited to smaller works, and arguably found its ideal sculptural form in early European porcelain, and interior decorative schemes in wood or plaster such as those in French domestic interiors and Austrian and Bavarian pilgrimage churches",1
"

		
		
		


==== Neo-Classical ====

The Neoclassical style that arrived in the late 18th century gave great emphasis to sculpture",1
" Jean-Antoine Houdon exemplifies the penetrating portrait sculpture the style could produce, and Antonio Canova's nudes the idealist aspect of the movement",1
" The Neoclassical period was one of the great ages of public sculpture, though its ""classical"" prototypes were more likely to be Roman copies of Hellenistic sculptures",1
" In sculpture, the most familiar representatives are the Italian Antonio Canova, the Englishman John Flaxman and the Dane Bertel Thorvaldsen",1
" The European neoclassical manner also took hold in the United States, where its pinnacle occurred somewhat later and is exemplified in the sculptures of Hiram Powers",1
"

		
		
		


=== Asia ===


==== Greco-Buddhist sculpture and Asia ====

Greco-Buddhist art is the artistic manifestation of Greco-Buddhism, a cultural syncretism between the Classical Greek culture and Buddhism, which developed over a period of close to 1000 years in Central Asia, between the conquests of Alexander the Great in the 4th century BCE, and the Islamic conquests of the 7th century CE",1
" Greco-Buddhist art is characterized by the strong idealistic realism of Hellenistic art and the first representations of the Buddha in human form, which have helped define the artistic (and particularly, sculptural) canon for Buddhist art throughout the Asian continent up to the present",1
" Though dating is uncertain, it appears that strongly Hellenistic styles lingered in the East for several centuries after they had declined around the Mediterranean, as late as the 5th century CE",1
" Some aspects of Greek art were adopted while others did not spread beyond the Greco-Buddhist area; in particular the standing figure, often with a relaxed pose and one leg flexed, and the flying cupids or victories, who became popular across Asia as apsaras",1
" Greek foliage decoration was also influential, with Indian versions of the Corinthian capital appearing",1
"The origins of Greco-Buddhist art are to be found in the Hellenistic Greco-Bactrian kingdom (250–130 BCE), located in today's Afghanistan, from which Hellenistic culture radiated into the Indian subcontinent with the establishment of the small Indo-Greek kingdom (180–10 BCE)",1
" Under the Indo-Greeks and then the Kushans, the interaction of Greek and Buddhist culture flourished in the area of Gandhara, in today's northern Pakistan, before spreading further into India, influencing the art of Mathura, and then the Hindu art of the Gupta empire, which was to extend to the rest of South-East Asia",1
" The influence of Greco-Buddhist art also spread northward towards Central Asia, strongly affecting the art of the Tarim Basin and the Dunhuang Caves, and ultimately the sculpted figure in China, Korea, and Japan",1
"

		
		
		
		
		
		


==== China ====

Chinese ritual bronzes from the Shang and Western Zhou Dynasties come from a period of over a thousand years from c",1
" 1500 BCE, and have exerted a continuing influence over Chinese art",1
" They are cast with complex patterned and zoomorphic decoration, but avoid the human figure, unlike the huge figures only recently discovered at Sanxingdui",1
"  The spectacular Terracotta Army was assembled for the tomb of Qin Shi Huang, the first emperor of a unified China from 221 to 210 BCE, as a grand imperial version of the figures long placed in tombs to enable the deceased to enjoy the same lifestyle in the afterlife as when alive, replacing actual sacrifices of very early periods",1
" Smaller figures in pottery or wood were placed in tombs for many centuries afterwards, reaching a peak of quality in Tang dynasty tomb figures",1
"  The tradition of unusually large pottery figures persisted in China, through Tang sancai tomb figures to later Buddhist statues such as the near life-size set of Yixian glazed pottery luohans and later figures for temples and tombs",1
  These came to replace earlier equivalents in wood,1
"
Native Chinese religions do not usually use cult images of deities, or even represent them, and large religious sculpture is nearly all Buddhist, dating mostly from the 4th to the 14th century, and initially using Greco-Buddhist models arriving via the Silk Road",1
" Buddhism is also the context of all large portrait sculpture; in total contrast to some other areas, in medieval China even painted images of the emperor were regarded as private",1
" Imperial tombs have spectacular avenues of approach lined with real and mythological animals on a scale matching Egypt, and smaller versions decorate temples and palaces",1
"Small Buddhist figures and groups were produced to a very high quality in a range of media, as was relief decoration of all sorts of objects, especially in metalwork and jade",1
"  In the earlier periods, large quantities of sculpture were cut from the living rock in pilgrimage cave-complexes, and as outside rock reliefs",1
  These were mostly originally painted,1
"  In notable contrast to literati painters, sculptors of all sorts were regarded as artisans and very few names are recorded",1
"  From the Ming dynasty onwards, statuettes of religious and secular figures were produced in Chinese porcelain and other media, which became an important export",1
"

		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		


==== Japan ====

Towards the end of the long Neolithic Jōmon period, some pottery vessels were ""flame-rimmed"" with extravagant extensions to the rim that can only be called sculptural, and very stylized pottery dogū figures were produced, many with the characteristic ""snow-goggle"" eyes",1
" During the Kofun period of the 3rd to 6th century CE, haniwa terracotta figures of humans and animals in a simplistic style were erected outside important tombs",1
" The arrival of Buddhism in the 6th century brought with it sophisticated traditions in sculpture, Chinese styles mediated via Korea",1
" The 7th-century Hōryū-ji and its contents have survived more intact than any East Asian Buddhist temple of its date, with works including a Shaka Trinity of 623 in bronze, showing the historical Buddha flanked by two bodhisattvas and also the Guardian Kings of the Four Directions",1
Jōchō is said to be one of the greatest Buddhist sculptors not only in Heian period but also in the history of Buddhist statues in Japan,1
" Jōchō redefined the body shape of Buddha statues by perfecting the technique of ""yosegi zukuri"" (寄木造り) which is a combination of several woods",1
" The peaceful expression and graceful figure of the Buddha statue that he made completed a Japanese style of sculpture of Buddha statues called ""Jōchō yō"" (Jōchō style, 定朝様) and determined the style of Japanese Buddhist statues of the later period",1
 His achievement dramatically raised the social status of busshi (Buddhist sculptor) in Japan,1
"In the Kamakura period, the Minamoto clan established the Kamakura shogunate  and the samurai class virtually ruled Japan for the first time",1
" Jocho's successors, sculptors of the Kei school of Buddhist statues, created realistic and dynamic statues to suit the tastes of samurai, and Japanese Buddhist sculpture reached its peak",1
" Unkei, Kaikei, and Tankei were famous, and they made many new Buddha statues at many temples such as Kofuku-ji, where many Buddha statues had been lost in wars and fires",1
"Almost all subsequent significant large sculpture in Japan was Buddhist, with some Shinto equivalents, and after Buddhism declined in Japan in the 15th century, monumental sculpture became largely architectural decoration and less significant",1
"  However sculptural work in the decorative arts was developed to a remarkable level of technical achievement and refinement in small objects such as inro and netsuke in many materials, and metal tosogu or Japanese sword mountings",1
" In the 19th century there were export industries of small bronze sculptures of extreme virtuosity, ivory and porcelain figurines, and other types of small sculpture, increasingly emphasizing technical accomplishment",1
"

		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		


==== Indian subcontinent ====

The first known sculpture in the Indian subcontinent is from the Indus Valley civilization (3300–1700 BCE), found in sites at Mohenjo-daro and Harappa in modern-day Pakistan",1
 These include the famous small bronze female dancer and the so-called Priest-king,1
"  However, such figures in bronze and stone are rare and greatly outnumbered by pottery figurines and stone seals, often of animals or deities very finely depicted",1
" After the collapse of the Indus Valley civilization there is little record of sculpture until the Buddhist era, apart from a hoard of copper figures of (somewhat controversially) c",1
 1500 BCE from Daimabad,1
"  Thus the great tradition of Indian monumental sculpture in stone appears to begin, relative to other cultures, and the development of Indian civilization, relatively late, with the reign of Asoka from 270 to 232 BCE, and the Pillars of Ashoka he erected around India, carrying his edicts and topped by famous sculptures of animals, mostly lions, of which six survive",1
"  Large amounts of figurative sculpture, mostly in relief, survive from Early Buddhist pilgrimage stupas, above all Sanchi; these probably developed out of a tradition using wood that also embraced Hinduism",1
"The pink sandstone Hindu, Jain and Buddhist sculptures of Mathura from the 1st to 3rd centuries CE reflected both native Indian traditions and the Western influences received through the Greco-Buddhist art of Gandhara, and effectively established the basis for subsequent Indian religious sculpture",1
  The style was developed and diffused through most of India under the Gupta Empire (c,1
" 320–550) which remains a ""classical"" period for Indian sculpture, covering the earlier Ellora Caves, though the Elephanta Caves are probably slightly later",1
"  Later large-scale sculpture remains almost exclusively religious, and generally rather conservative, often reverting to simple frontal standing poses for deities, though the attendant spirits such as apsaras and yakshi often have sensuously curving poses",1
" Carving is often highly detailed, with an intricate backing behind the main figure in high relief",1
 The celebrated bronzes of the Chola dynasty (c,1
" 850–1250) from south India, many designed to be carried in processions, include the iconic form of Shiva as Nataraja, with the massive granite carvings of Mahabalipuram dating from the previous Pallava dynasty",1
"

		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		


==== South-East Asia ====

The sculpture of the region tends to be characterised by a high degree of ornamentation, as seen in the great monuments of Hindu and Buddhist Khmer sculpture (9th to 13th centuries) at Angkor Wat and elsewhere, the enormous 9th-century Buddhist complex at Borobudur in Java, and the Hindu monuments of Bali",1
" Both of these include many reliefs as well as figures in the round; Borobudur has 2,672 relief panels, 504 Buddha statues, many semi-concealed in openwork stupas, and many large guardian figures",1
"
In Thailand and Laos, sculpture was mainly of Buddha images, often gilded, both large for temples and monasteries, and small figurines for private homes",1
 Traditional sculpture in Myanmar emerged before the Bagan period,1
" As elsewhere in the region, most of the wood sculptures of the Bagan and Ava periods have been lost",1
" 
Traditional Anitist sculptures from the Philippines are dominated by Anitist designs mirroring the medium used and the culture involved, while being highlighted by the environments where such sculptures are usually placed on",1
 Christian and Islamic sculptures from the Philippines have different motifs compared to other Christian and Islamic sculptures elsewhere,1
" In later periods Chinese influence predominated in Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia, and more wooden sculpture survives from across the region",1
"

		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		


=== Islam ===

Islam is famously aniconic, so the vast majority of sculpture is arabesque decoration in relief or openwork, based on vegetable motifs, but tending to geometrical abstract forms",1
" In the very early Mshatta Facade (740s), now mostly in Berlin, there are animals within the dense arabesques in high relief, and figures of animals and men in mostly low relief are found in conjunction with decoration on many later pieces in various materials, including metalwork, ivory and ceramics",1
"Figures of animals in the round were often acceptable for works used in private contexts if the object was clearly practical, so medieval Islamic art contains many metal animals that are aquamaniles, incense burners or supporters for fountains, as in the stone lions supporting the famous one in the Alhambra, culminating in the largest medieval Islamic animal figure known, the Pisa Griffin",1
" In the same way, luxury hardstone carvings such as dagger hilts and cups may be formed as animals, especially in Mughal art",1
" The degree of acceptability of such relaxations of strict Islamic rules varies between periods and regions, with Islamic Spain, Persia and India often leading relaxation, and is typically highest in courtly contexts",1
"

		
		
		


=== Africa ===

Historically, with the exception of some monumental Egyptian sculpture, most African sculpture was created in wood and other organic materials that have not survived from earlier than a few centuries ago; older pottery figures are found from a number of areas",1
" Masks are important elements in the art of many peoples, along with human figures, often highly stylized",1
" There is a vast variety of styles, often varying within the same context of origin depending on the use of the object, but wide regional trends are apparent; sculpture is most common among ""groups of settled cultivators in the areas drained by the Niger and Congo rivers"" in West Africa",1
"  Direct images of deities are relatively infrequent, but masks in particular are or were often made for religious ceremonies; today many are made for tourists as ""airport art""",1
"  African masks were an influence on European Modernist art, which was inspired by their lack of concern for naturalistic depiction",1
"
The Nubian Kingdom of Kush in modern Sudan was in close and often hostile contact with Egypt, and produced monumental sculpture mostly derivative of styles to the north",1
" In West Africa, the earliest known sculptures are from the Nok culture which thrived between 500 BCE and 500 CE in modern Nigeria, with clay figures typically with elongated bodies and angular shapes",1
" Later West African cultures developed bronze casting for reliefs to decorate palaces like the famous Benin Bronzes, and very fine naturalistic royal heads from around the Yoruba town of Ife in terracotta and metal from the 12th–14th centuries",1
" Akan goldweights are a form of small metal sculptures produced over the period 1400–1900, some apparently representing proverbs and so with a narrative element rare in African sculpture, and royal regalia included impressive gold sculptured elements",1
Many West African figures are used in religious rituals and are often coated with materials placed on them for ceremonial offerings,1
" The Mande-speaking peoples of the same region make pieces of wood with broad, flat surfaces and arms and legs are shaped like cylinders",1
" In Central Africa, however, the main distinguishing characteristics include heart-shaped faces that are curved inward and display patterns of circles and dots",1
"
Populations in the African Great Lakes are not known for their sculpture",1
" However, one style from the region is pole sculptures, carved in human shapes and decorated with geometric forms, while the tops are carved with figures of animals, people, and various objects",1
" These poles are, then, placed next to graves and are associated with death and the ancestral world",1
 The culture known from Great Zimbabwe left more impressive buildings than sculpture but the eight soapstone Zimbabwe Birds appear to have had a special significance and were mounted on monoliths,1
 Modern Zimbabwean sculptors in soapstone have achieved considerable international success,1
 Southern Africa's oldest known clay figures date from 400 to 600 CE and have cylindrical heads with a mixture of human and animal features,1
"

		
		
		
		
		
		
		


==== Ethiopia and Eritrea ====

The creation of sculptures in Ethiopia and Eritrea can be traced back to its ancient past with the kingdoms of Dʿmt and Aksum",1
" Christian art was established in Ethiopia with the conversion from paganism to Christianity in the 4th century CE, during the reign of king Ezana of Axum",1
 Christian imagery decorated churches during the Asksumite period and later eras,1
" For instance, at Lalibela, life-size saints were carved into the Church of Bet Golgotha; by tradition these were made during the reign of the Zagwe ruler Gebre Mesqel Lalibela in the 12th century, but they were more likely crafted in the 15th century during the Solomonic dynasty",1
" However, the Church of Saint George, Lalibela, one of several examples of rock cut architecture at Lalibela containing intricate carvings, was built in the 10th–13th centuries as proven by archaeology",1

In ancient Sudan, the development of sculpture stretches from the simple pottery of the Kerma culture beginning around 2500 BCE to the monumental statuary and architecture of the Kingdom of Kush, its last phase—the Meroitic period—ending around 350 CE (with its conquest by Ethiopia's Aksum)",1
" Beyond pottery items, the Kerma culture also made furniture that contained sculptures, such as gold cattle hoofs as the legs of beds",1
" Sculpture during the Kingdom of Kush included full-sized statues (especially of kings and queens), smaller figurines (most commonly depicting royal servants), and reliefs in stone, which were influenced by the contemporary ancient Egyptian sculptural tradition",1
"

		
		
		
		
		


=== The Americas ===

Sculpture in what is now Latin America developed in two separate and distinct areas, Mesoamerica in the north and Peru in the south",1
" In both areas, sculpture was initially of stone, and later of terracotta and metal as the civilizations in these areas became more technologically proficient",1
" The Mesoamerican region produced more monumental sculpture, from the massive block-like works of the Olmec and Toltec cultures, to the superb low reliefs that characterize the Mayan and Aztec cultures",1
" In the Andean region, sculptures were typically small, but often show superb skill",1
"

==== North America ====

In North America, wood was sculpted for totem poles, masks, utensils, War canoes and a variety of other uses, with distinct variation between different cultures and regions",1
" The most developed styles are those of the Pacific Northwest Coast, where a group of elaborate and highly stylized formal styles developed forming the basis of a tradition that continues today",1
" In addition to the famous totem poles, painted and carved house fronts were complemented by carved posts inside and out, as well as mortuary figures and other items",1
" Among the Inuit of the far north, traditional carving styles in ivory and soapstone are still continued",1
"The arrival of European Catholic culture readily adapted local skills to the prevailing Baroque style, producing enormously elaborate retablos and other mostly church sculptures in a variety of hybrid styles",1
" The most famous of such examples in Canada is the altar area of the Notre Dame Basilica in Montreal, Quebec, which was carved by peasant habitant labourers",1
" Later, artists trained in the Western academic tradition followed European styles until in the late 19th century they began to draw again on indigenous influences, notably in the Mexican baroque grotesque style known as Churrigueresque",1
" Aboriginal peoples also adapted church sculpture in variations on Carpenter Gothic; one famous example is the Church of the Holy Cross in Skookumchuck Hot Springs, British Columbia",1
"
The history of sculpture in the United States after Europeans' arrival reflects the country's 18th-century foundation in Roman republican civic values and Protestant Christianity",1
" Compared to areas colonized by the Spanish, sculpture got off to an extremely slow start in the British colonies, with next to no place in churches, and was only given impetus by the need to assert nationality after independence",1
" American sculpture of the mid- to late-19th century was often classical, often romantic, but showed a bent for a dramatic, narrative, almost journalistic realism",1
" Public buildings during the last quarter of the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century often provided an architectural setting for sculpture, especially in relief",1
 By the 1930s the International Style of architecture and design and art deco characterized by the work of Paul Manship and Lee Lawrie and others became popular,1
" By the 1950s, traditional sculpture education would almost be completely replaced by a Bauhaus-influenced concern for abstract design",1
 Minimalist sculpture replaced the figure in public settings and architects almost completely stopped using sculpture in or on their designs,1
 Modern sculptors (21st century) use both classical and abstract inspired designs,1
" Beginning in the 1980s, there was a swing back toward figurative public sculpture; by 2000, many of the new public pieces in the United States were figurative in design",1
"

		
		
		
		
		
		
		


== Moving toward modern art ==


=== 19th–early 20th century, early Modernism and continuing realism ===

		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		

Modern classicism contrasted in many ways with the classical sculpture of the 19th century which was characterized by commitments to naturalism (Antoine-Louis Barye)—the melodramatic (François Rude) sentimentality (Jean-Baptiste Carpeaux)—or a kind of stately grandiosity (Lord Leighton)",1
" Several different directions in the classical tradition were taken as the century turned, but the study of the live model and the post-Renaissance tradition was still fundamental to them",1
"
Auguste Rodin was the most renowned European sculptor of the early 20th century",1
" He is often considered a sculptural Impressionist, as are his students including Camille Claudel, and Hugo Rheinhold, attempting to model of a fleeting moment of ordinary life",1
"
Modern classicism showed a lesser interest in naturalism and a greater interest in formal stylization",1
" Greater attention was paid to the rhythms of volumes and spaces—as well as greater attention to the contrasting qualities of surface (open, closed, planar, broken etc",1
) while less attention was paid to story-telling and convincing details of anatomy or costume,1
" Greater attention was given to psychological effect than to physical realism, and influences from earlier styles worldwide were used",1
"
Early masters of modern classicism included: Aristide Maillol, Alexander Matveyev, Joseph Bernard, Antoine Bourdelle, Georg Kolbe, Libero Andreotti, Gustav Vigeland, Jan Stursa, Constantin Brâncuși",1
" As the century progressed, modern classicism was adopted as the national style of the two great European totalitarian empires: Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia, who co-opted the work of earlier artists such as Kolbe and Wilhelm Lehmbruck in Germany and Matveyev in Russia",1
" Over the 70 years of the USSR, new generations of sculptors were trained and chosen within their system, and a distinct style, socialist realism, developed, that returned to the 19th century's emphasis on melodrama and naturalism",1
"
Classical training was rooted out of art education in Western Europe (and the Americas) by 1970 and the classical variants of the 20th century were marginalized in the history of modernism",1
" But classicism continued as the foundation of art education in the Soviet academies until 1990, providing a foundation for expressive figurative art throughout eastern Europe and parts of the Middle East",1
" By 2000, the European classical tradition retains a wide appeal to the public but awaits an educational tradition to revive its contemporary development",1
"
Some of the modern classical became either more decorative/art deco (Paul Manship, Jose de Creeft, Carl Milles) or more abstractly stylized or more expressive (and Gothic) (Anton Hanak, Wilhelm Lehmbruck, Ernst Barlach, Arturo Martini)—or turned more to the Renaissance (Giacomo Manzù, Venanzo Crocetti) or stayed the same (Charles Despiau, Marcel Gimond)",1
"


== Modernism ==

Modernist sculpture movements include Cubism, Geometric abstraction, De Stijl, Suprematism, Constructivism, Dadaism, Surrealism, Futurism, Formalism, Abstract expressionism, Pop-Art, Minimalism, Land art, and Installation art among others",1
"

In the early days of the 20th century, Pablo Picasso revolutionized the art of sculpture when he began creating his constructions fashioned by combining disparate objects and materials into one constructed piece of sculpture; the sculptural equivalent of the collage in two-dimensional art",1
" The advent of Surrealism led to things occasionally being described as ""sculpture"" that would not have been so previously, such as ""involuntary sculpture"" in several senses, including coulage",1
" In later years Picasso became a prolific potter, leading, with interest in historic pottery from around the world, to a revival of ceramic art, with figures such as George E",1
" Ohr and subsequently Peter Voulkos, Kenneth Price, and Robert Arneson",1
" Marcel Duchamp originated the use of the ""found object"" (French: objet trouvé) or readymade with pieces such as Fountain (1917)",1
"
Similarly, the work of Constantin Brâncuși at the beginning of the century paved the way for later abstract sculpture",1
" In revolt against the naturalism of Rodin and his late-19th-century contemporaries, Brâncuși distilled subjects down to their essences as illustrated by the elegantly refined forms of his Bird in Space series (1924)",1
"Brâncuși's impact, with his vocabulary of reduction and abstraction, is seen throughout the 1930s and 1940s, and exemplified by artists such as Gaston Lachaise, Sir Jacob Epstein, Henry Moore, Alberto Giacometti, Joan Miró, Julio González, Pablo Serrano, Jacques Lipchitz and by the 1940s abstract sculpture was impacted and expanded by Alexander Calder, Len Lye, Jean Tinguely, and Frederick Kiesler who were pioneers of Kinetic art",1
"
Modernist sculptors largely missed out on the huge boom in public art resulting from the demand for war memorials for the two World Wars, but from the 1950s the public and commissioning bodies became more comfortable with Modernist sculpture and large public commissions both abstract and figurative became common",1
" Picasso was commissioned to make a maquette for a huge 50-foot (15 m)-high public sculpture, the so-called Chicago Picasso (1967)",1
" His design was ambiguous and somewhat controversial, and what the figure represents is not clear; it could be a bird, a horse, a woman or a totally abstract shape",1
"
During the late 1950s and the 1960s abstract sculptors began experimenting with a wide array of new materials and different approaches to creating their work",1
" Surrealist imagery, anthropomorphic abstraction, new materials and combinations of new energy sources and varied surfaces and objects became characteristic of much new modernist sculpture",1
" Collaborative projects with landscape designers, architects, and landscape architects expanded the outdoor site and contextual integration",1
" Artists such as Isamu Noguchi, David Smith, Alexander Calder, Jean Tinguely, Richard Lippold, George Rickey, Louise Bourgeois, Philip Pavia and Louise Nevelson came to characterize the look of modern sculpture",1
"
By the 1960s Abstract expressionism, Geometric abstraction and Minimalism, which reduces sculpture to its most essential and fundamental features, predominated",1
" Some works of the period are: the Cubi works of David Smith, and the welded steel works of Sir Anthony Caro, as well as welded sculpture by a large variety of sculptors, the large-scale work of John Chamberlain, and environmental installation scale works by Mark di Suvero",1
" Other Minimalists include Tony Smith, Donald Judd, Robert Morris, Anne Truitt, Giacomo Benevelli, Arnaldo Pomodoro, Richard Serra, Dan Flavin, Carl Andre, and John Safer who added motion and monumentality to the theme of purity of line",1
"During the 1960s and 1970s figurative sculpture by modernist artists in stylized forms was made by artists such as Leonard Baskin, Ernest Trova, George Segal, Marisol Escobar, Paul Thek, Robert Graham in a classic articulated style, and Fernando Botero bringing his painting's 'oversized figures' into monumental sculptures",1
"

=== Contemporary movements ===

Site specific and environmental art works are represented by artists: Andy Goldsworthy, Walter De Maria, Richard Long, Richard Serra, Robert Irwin, George Rickey and Christo and Jeanne-Claude led contemporary abstract sculpture in new directions",1
 Artists created environmental sculpture on expansive sites in the 'land art in the American West' group of projects,1
" These land art or 'earth art' environmental scale sculpture works exemplified by artists such as Robert Smithson, Michael Heizer, James Turrell (Roden Crater)",1
" Eva Hesse, Sol LeWitt, Jackie Winsor, Keith Sonnier, Bruce Nauman and Dennis Oppenheim among others were pioneers of Postminimalist sculpture",1
"
Also during the 1960s and 1970s artists as diverse as Eduardo Paolozzi, Chryssa, Claes Oldenburg, George Segal, Edward Kienholz, Nam June Paik, Wolf Vostell, Duane Hanson, and John DeAndrea explored abstraction, imagery and figuration through video art, environment, light sculpture, and installation art in new ways",1
"
Conceptual art is art in which the concept(s) or idea(s) involved in the work take precedence over traditional aesthetic and material concerns",1
" Works include One and Three Chairs, 1965, is by Joseph Kosuth, and An Oak Tree by Michael Craig-Martin, and those of Joseph Beuys, James Turrell and Jacek Tylicki",1
"


=== Minimalism ===

		
		
		
		


==== Postminimalism ====

		
		
		
		
		


==== Contemporary genres ====

Some modern sculpture forms are now practiced outdoors, as environmental art and environmental sculpture, often in full view of spectators",1
" Light sculpture, street art sculpture and site-specific art also often make use of the environment",1
 Ice sculpture is a form of ephemeral sculpture that uses ice as the raw material,1
" It is popular in China, Japan, Canada, Sweden, and Russia",1
" Ice sculptures feature decoratively in some cuisines, especially in Asia",1
" Kinetic sculptures are sculptures that are designed to move, which include mobiles",1
 Snow sculptures are usually carved out of a single block of snow about 6 to 15 feet (1,1
8 to 4,1
6 m) on each side and weighing about 20–30 tons,1
 The snow is densely packed into a form after having been produced by artificial means or collected from the ground after a snowfall,1
" Sound sculptures take the form of indoor sound installations, outdoor installations such as aeolian harps, automatons, or be more or less near conventional musical instruments",1
 Sound sculpture is often site-specific,1
" Art toys have become another format for contemporary artists since the late 1990s, such as those produced by Takashi Murakami and Kid Robot, designed by Michael Lau, or hand-made by Michael Leavitt (artist)",1
"


== Conservation ==

Sculptures are sensitive to environmental conditions such as temperature, humidity and exposure to light and ultraviolet light",1
 Acid rain can also cause damage to certain building materials and historical monuments,1
" This results when sulfuric acid in the rain chemically reacts with the calcium compounds in the stones (limestone, sandstone, marble and granite) to create gypsum, which then flakes off",1
 Severe air pollution also causes damage to historical monuments,1
"
At any time many contemporary sculptures have usually been on display in public places; theft was not a problem as pieces were instantly recognisable",1
" In the early 21st century the value of metal rose to such an extent that theft of massive bronze sculpture for the value of the metal became a problem; sculpture worth millions being stolen and melted down for the relatively low value of the metal, a tiny fraction of the value of the artwork",1
